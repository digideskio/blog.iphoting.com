<p class="whiteline"><p>This has to be one of the most exciting test I&#8217;ve ever encountered in my life. It was short beyond measure, commonly indicative of a failure, fraught with fright, and God must have simply intervened.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Basically, I&#8217;ve just completed the circuit with no issues and am on the public road. At this T-junction without traffic lights, I was to turn right into a smaller road. The coast, with slight visual obstruction (due to cars turning to their right in-front of me), was clear. I looked right to check for pedestrians, while preparing to move off. The car was about to inch forward when I looked forward and saw a lorry dashing towards the junction.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;Oooh,&#8221; I exclaimed, while I instinctively stomped on the brakes hard. From the corner of my eye, I saw the examiner&#8217;s hand moved towards the handbrake column – I was faster. He made no remark, neither did I.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I completed the turn and he told me to turn right, and then back into the driving centre, which is on the left. This was immediately disappointing as I&#8217;ve only just completed 3 right turns on the road without any U-turns. Most routes have at least a U-turn, I recalled. It must have been over, I thought to myself.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>He motioned for me to park at the shade in-front of the centre; I was the second car to arrive. The first being called for the test a full 5 minutes before me. I was after all, one of the last few to start the test. It was certainly a foreboding sight.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Silently, we moved to the desk and I sat there awaiting my results. I had expected the worst. I mean, what more can go wrong? Ending the test way earlier than others, dead silence, and one huge mistake which I&#8217;m almost sure was an immediate failure.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>He came with a slip of paper in his hands, the revelation on the price which I was to pay – S$200 (re-test) or S$50 (driving license application fee).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>His words were sharp, &#8220;check your mirrors more.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>He moved the paper towards me. I strained to read the tiny words and what they had all meant. He pulled back and flipped over.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve passed... congratulations and please proceed to watch the safety video&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With that, I mumbled many thank yous and promptly left the room. Was I dreaming? I dropped my mother a quick phone call, and realised that she couldn&#8217;t read my mind (and thus it isn&#8217;t a dream). I scanned the mistakes list and didn&#8217;t see what I thought I&#8217;ll see.</p>
