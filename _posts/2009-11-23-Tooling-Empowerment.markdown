<p class="whiteline"><p>One of the things I&#8217;m trying very hard to improve is my expression through written and verbal methods. I find it troubling and difficult to express what and how I feel in accurate and concise terms. Unintentionally, it leaves people with an inaccurate impression of what I originally intend to mean. The implications aren&#8217;t so bad when the subject-matter is largely technical, but when it comes to things that matter to the heart and soul, unintentional problems and misunderstandings can arise.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Although I&#8217;m an INTJ according to some personality tests, I have great passion in trying to empower people I meet to be able to do &#8220;meta-learning&#8221;. Rather than knowing as much data as possible to be knowledgeable, why not know as many possible methods of seeking out information and solutions instead? That way, whatever problems that you come across, you&#8217;ll have the tools and skills to discover the solutions and answers yourself.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As I hand over my work in the current organisation, I&#8217;d spent almost all available time trying to impart thinking ability rather than rote-memorisation abilities. The nature of my work is largely ad-hoc problem solving and fire fighting; being able to know how to come up with solutions when you&#8217;re out of ideas is the key to surviving comfortably.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Little did I expect however, in the words of Henry Ford, &#8220;Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it&#8221;. I can only resign and sigh, wishing them all the best.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>One of my good friends once asked how I seem to be able to have access to timely intelligence information pertaining to everyday life and happenings in the organisation. I&#8217;ve always maintained that it&#8217;s the result of a robust &#8220;Int[elligence] Network&#8221;. The concept is extremely simple—people volunteer interesting information of what they see and experience during casual conversations. As long as you do more listening than talking, you&#8217;ll be able to gain a wealth of information. It sounds awfully like gossip but it isn&#8217;t as long as you don&#8217;t volunteer nor listen to unreliable information about other people behind their back.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With a little bit of induction-deduction and a lot of listening, you&#8217;ll be able to obtain a lot more information than most people. A plus if you are observant as there&#8217;s as much information volunteered as restrained; double-plus if you ask the right questions; triple-plus if you know the right people for the right type information. With a good memory and pleasant working relationships, you&#8217;ll be powerfully connected.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>So really, these are the little things in office that keep me mentally entertained in an alternative way; true to Apple, Inc&#8217;s philosophy—Think Different.</p></p>
