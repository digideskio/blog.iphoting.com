<p class="break"><p>Looking at the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/']);"  href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/">Palm Pre</a> concept demonstration videos, I can&#8217;t help but smile â€“ the Palm that I&#8217;d known in my primary school days.</p><p class="break"><!-- s9ymdb:95 --><img class="serendipity_image_center" width="259" height="445" src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/uploads/Computers/PalmPre.jpg" alt="" /></p><p class="whiteline">A simple, unified and consistent interface, efficient access, flawless synchronisation and a huge 3rd party application eco-system.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Assuming that it delivers as advertised, its potential is vast and unhindered. Probably a renaissance for Palm, finally.</p>
