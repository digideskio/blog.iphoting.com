[Shawn Blanc][source]:

> It’s unfortunate that many people don’t think about backing up their data until it’s too late. I can’t imagine how devastating it would be to lose weeks, months, or years worth of family photos, important documents, project folders, and more.

Especially, in [the case of Mat Honan][mat], he lost everything just because he didn't make usable backups (security issues are a topic of discussion for another day).

In Shawn's post, he talks about how to go about creating a good backup system, and must consist of the following:

- Local
- Off-site
- Automated

This provides the necessary redundancy and convenience for the unfortunate eventuality.

If you're still hesitating, go read the article and get working on creating backups.

Ultimately, we all should have a system like his:

> For $10 month and very little energy I have a system that backs up my data redundantly, securely, and thoroughly. And I don’t have to initiate anything to make it happen.

Realistically, only 10% of computer users have such a system; don't be the 90%. It's really simple to get going, just read his post.
