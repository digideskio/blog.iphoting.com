<p class="whiteline"><p>I went to the mothership today and was pretty impressed. Intimidating access controls with undulating terrain to protect its inhabitants.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, for the first time in my life, I get to operate a 36" wide colour printer, that prints on rolls of white paper. I mean, these prints would easily cost hundreds and we&#8217;re just clicking print as though it is free.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In addition, I was rather impressed with Photoshop CS2&#8217;s performance on windows while dealing with 2 GB huge <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format">tiffs</a>. Photoshop displayed a responsive progress bar below on all image operations as they tend to take a few minutes for a file that huge.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For those of you curious, the image on average was over 50k inches wide and tall, approximately (but strangely) at 1 pixel per inch. We had to resize it down to usable sizes as they only had 36" wide paper available then.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh well, I still love my job. Everyday is a different day.</p></p>
