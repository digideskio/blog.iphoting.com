[Statista][source] posted a note comparing Apple's net profit in 2012 across its various industry competitors:

> <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/uploads/ChartOfTheDay_735_Apple_s_Astonishing_Profit_in_Context_n.jpg">

> How huge these numbers really are becomes more evident when compared to the results of Apple’s competition: 

> • From October 2011 through September 2012, the combined net profit of Microsoft, Google, eBay, Yahoo, Facebook and Amazon was $34.4 billion. Apple alone made $7 billion more.

> • In the same period, Dell, Asus, Intel, Acer, IBM, Lenovo and HP, i.e. virtually the entire PC industry, made $19.3 billion or less than half of Apple’s profit. 

Simply mind-blowing.
