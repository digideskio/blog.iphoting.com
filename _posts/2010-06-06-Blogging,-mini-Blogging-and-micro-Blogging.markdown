<p class="whiteline"><p>The problem of content sharing has never been a new one but the recent influx of content sharing options and platforms have given this problem which was once solved an added dimension.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In the beginning, the only way for a user to share content to the public, be it a link, thought, or a joke, was to do so via his own website. This was a complex procedure that only the very tech-savvy was capable of pulling off.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, push-button publishing, popularised by Blogger, came along and it made sharing content with the public a whole lot easier. Still, some degree of technical compentency was needed but not as much as before.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, Twitter popularised the concept of micro-blogging where users can publish content not longer than 160 characters. Tumblr came along and extended it to mini-blogging where users are encouraged to share short snippets of contents that have trouble fitting within a tweet.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Facebook, determined to be the social site, started emphasising on sharing features within the Facebook community. This community however is a walled garden where only authorised friends are allowed viewership and comment on users shared content. Worse, the ability to search through past shared content is almost nonexistent. It&#8217;s almost perfect for sharing short links due to the convenience but with limited reach.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I have been a lot busier over the past month and have fallen into the trap of using Facebook as the primary way to share interesting content. Given the reasons above, I&#8217;ve decided to share short content via my <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/tumblr.iphoting.com/']);"  href="http://tumblr.iphoting.com/">Tumblr</a> instead, leaving longer and denser posts for my Blog. This way, my blog won&#8217;t be cluttered with numerous short shared content pieces.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>So, follow my <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/tumblr.iphoting.com/']);"  href="http://tumblr.iphoting.com/">Tumblr</a> for content that used to be shared on my Facebook profile only, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/twitter.com/iphoting']);"  href="http://twitter.com/iphoting">Twitter</a> for status updates, and this blog for longer posts.</p></p>
