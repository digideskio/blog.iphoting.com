I think Ruby is almost there. Deploying a Ruby web-app is getting easier as we speak, with free hosts available (such as Heroku), and a easy to use Apache / Nginx module (Passenger). As for Python, slightly more work is needed to streamline deployment options.

Java is a gone case. The closest usable thing is probably the [Play Framework][play], available in both Java and Scala. It throws out most Java EE standards and takes after some conventions popularised by Ruby on Rails.
