<p class="whiteline"><p>I quote from two-am.org:-</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;A<em>S(</em>) is gonna suck now. Teachers left, weird things happen. Sigh. Whats D<em>o</em>g thinking. A<em>i</em>t<em>i</em> C<em>e</em> got demoted cause of something he said online which wasn&#8217;t wrong and I felt that it was quite true. And like 21 teachers left or something, A<em>S(</em>) is gonna really suck. I wonder who was that bitch/bastard that went to complain. Fucking shame on you. But he took it like a man, I was suprised that he didn&#8217;t ask them to stfu and left.&#8221;</p>
