<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;This is the most solemn chapel ever&#8221;, I agree. In fact, the number of people who were awake was record-breaking. That should explain why teachers themselves didn&#8217;t walk around. The guitar, or the lack thereof, certainly sets the tone of praise.</p>

</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;ve poured through Lu Xun&#8217;s &#8220;A Madman&#8217;s Diary&#8221; quickly and found it extremely repetitive and somewhat boring. However, the message behind it is not to be underestimated. Come to think of it, it might make a good EE topic.</p></p>
