<p class="whiteline"><p>For P.E. today, it was a little more &#8220;active&#8221; than normal. We did like dunno how many push-ups... I think 50 a set? Another 30 sit-ups and back to push-ups and back to site-ups, etc....You get the idea...</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, 3 rounds around the school. After all that &#8220;workout&#8221;, we&#8217;d still had 30min left before the end of period... :s.. But well, being as ignorant as we are, the P.E. teachers just let us off for a long 40min recess. (Supposed to be double split 20min recess periods.. grrh dunno why timetable this year so screwed).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, in A. Maths, lesson, the <em>new</em> teacher was pissed with us. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> She started comparing us to &#8220;Neighbourhood School&#8221; students <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/cool.png" alt="8-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> and Normal (Tech) Students and we are considered worst that two of them combined... LOL</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>She also claimed that her impression that ACS students are very good are fading away, as quickly as the tsunamis. Well.... Since when did <em>anyone</em> say that ACS had very good students? Assumptions are muddy...</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Simply said, she has no idea about the ACSpirit, making her at odds with most students, causing her agony.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>A simple way for her is to change her paradigm, lower expectations and do it <em>our</em> style.. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> If not, she could always change the school students, as if she could...</p></p>
