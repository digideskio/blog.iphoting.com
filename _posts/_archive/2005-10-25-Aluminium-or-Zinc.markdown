<p class="whiteline"><p>The Chemistry Practical today was uneventful and easy. My fears for the subsequent papers are hence confirmed. Chemisty has never been a subject that I&#8217;ll do well in based purely on theory work; but well, I&#8217;ll put in effort to see how far I could go.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>For those curious, my calculated molarity value was 0.101 mol/dm<sup>3</sup>. This value varies across schools, I&#8217;ve heard.</p><p class="whiteline">S, Aluminium; T, Lead and U, unknown. (Only need to identify 2 out of 3)</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There have been debates on whether S is Aluminium or Zinc, but I&#8217;m sure that the white ppt didn&#8217;t dissolve in excess aq. ammonia.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh well, I hope it didn&#8217;t go bad. In other words, an A1 is expected.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In other news, something which I&#8217;d predicted came true. <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.boingboing.net/2005/10/24/principal_says_stude.html']);"  href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/24/principal_says_stude.html">Principal says students can&#8217;t keep blogs or MySpace profiles</a>, in other words, blogging is banned.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I guess I shall refrain from posting cynical &#8220;hopes&#8221; of the future.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.longnow.org/projects/clock/orrery/']);"  href="http://www.longnow.org/projects/clock/orrery/">Orrery Clock</a> is just <em>beautiful</em>. It makes me wonder if full 2005 years have passed since A.D., assuming a year consists of 365.25 days.</p></p>
