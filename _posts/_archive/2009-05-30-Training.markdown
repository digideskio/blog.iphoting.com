<p class="whiteline"><p>Having been in my appointment for more than a year, I&#8217;ve finally been schedule to go for a course this week to become more &#8220;intelligent&#8221;. This course will last for four weeks, conducted somewhere near the Discovery Centre, with very poor accessibility from my house.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Long hours and weekend homework, feels much like school with tight deadlines.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>My apologies for lagging updates and responses as I&#8217;ve been staying in to take advantage of 7 am reveille.</p></p>
