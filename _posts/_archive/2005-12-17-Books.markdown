<p class="whiteline"><p>Went to pacific bookshop in school early this morning to buy books. It&#8217;s wonderful that they stock 3 out of the 5 books that I wanted. Not bad considering Kinokuniya fared as well and they are a much larger bookstore. Goodness me. The 3 books were thicker than 2 (traditional, not cd version of) yellowpages books. How can these book be transported? I&#8217;ve got no idea. I hope these are for home use and reference only. Lugging them around in anyway would be damaging to both bag and back. Needless to say, my arms would probably not be able to sustain such weight for long.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Had Swensens for dinner. Terrible service to say the least. None of the waiters were trained to spot for customers who need service; they only respond to frantic and rapid hand waving motions. I wish I don&#8217;t have to pay for that pesky 10% service charge; 1% will be an overkill.</p>
