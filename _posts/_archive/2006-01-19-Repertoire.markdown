<p class="whiteline"><p>My class has been completely different, in a good way, from my previous 2 and I&#8217;m glad about it. It&#8217;s refreshing to have breaths of new life, lighting up the place with never ending joy, generating excitement and extinguishing silence and boredom.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Finally got the habbit of using my camera phone for anything related to candid photography. After taking like 200 plus images, my phone is still left with 34mb of free space, and I&#8217;ve got no idea how I&#8217;m going to transfer them all onto my computer without too much human intervention.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And, there&#8217;s a new word. <i>Staplets</i>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Tomorrow will be a long day. Sigh... &#8216;Murphy&#8217; is always right, i.e. &#8216;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8217;The failure to plan is the plan to fail&#8217;. How true.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Now to my 2 sets of assignment due tomorrow.</p></p>
