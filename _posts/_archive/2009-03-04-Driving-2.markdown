<p class="whiteline"><p>I don&#8217;t believe that it is just me, but driving is an extremely mentally exhausting activity, especially along urban town areas where pedestrians and cars are of a plenty. It&#8217;s worse when your vehicle employs manual transmission. I have to admit, before I had started driving myself, I always thought that driving a vehicle is simple, not just in looks.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Add in the inching traffic and gentle up-slopes, your legs would be as tired as though you&#8217;ve walked up the slope yourself. The amusing &#8216;proper&#8217; method when starting a vehicle on a slope is to apply the handbrake and maintain half-clutch position. Release the handbrake and your car inches forward (gracefully). The hard part is to repeat this procedure 3 to five times and on the last time, your other free hand is busy turning the steering wheel right and you&#8217;re just looking out for incoming vehicles and stray pedestrians.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I have to admit, although it&#8217;s tiring, it&#8217;s pretty fun.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>A 2 hour long driving session at night after a long day at work is enough to knock me out the moment I&#8217;ve reached home.</p></p>
