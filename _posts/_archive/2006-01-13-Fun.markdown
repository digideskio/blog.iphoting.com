<p class="whiteline"><p>A week has passed and I&#8217;ve found that I didn&#8217;t lean much except for the ToK lectures. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve learnt a lot of stuff but it&#8217;s that the lectures are more interesting.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Business and Management is interesting too.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I can&#8217;t wait for the real stuff to start. Got to finish off my maths assignment before the due so I can finish up my other projects.</p></p>
