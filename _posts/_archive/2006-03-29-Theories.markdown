<p class="whiteline"><p>Whenever I sit before my computer, I feel exhausted and reluctant to do anything to my ToK essay. However, mentally I do have some thoughts on how to attempt it but I have yet to get myself to chain relevant arguments into a powerful and coherent one, suitable for a ToK essay, and penning or typing them down.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today&#8217;s mathematics lesson has been both a motivational and a saddening one. The teacher started the long lesson (5 periods; 1hr 40min) off by giving us some inspirational and motivational quotes. One of them, “千里之行，始于足下。”, in English, &#8220;the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.&#8221;, has been the most meaningful. No matter how hard or daunting a problem might seem to be, without even attempting it would certainly mean a failure. &#8220;You would never know how close you are to success when you quit&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, he also dwelt on what the Singapore education system has brought us to become. The following quotes, &#8220;I know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent; curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism have brought me to my ideas.&#8221; and &#8220;Intelligence is not the ability to store information, but to know where to find it.&#8221;, both written by Albert Einstein, speaks volumes about the education system here.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The sad news is that, as with most teachers who has whined before, he&#8217;s tired and found &#8216;teaching&#8217; too stressful. Most unfortunately, he has also announced plans to stop teaching next year. That&#8217;s really saddening as he&#8217;s the only teacher who has taught me and yet managed to captivate my utmost and über respect, albeit in such short time.</p>

</p><p class="break"><p>That aside, I&#8217;ve got to drag myself back to the question &#8220;can a machine know?&#8221;.</p></p>
