<p class="whiteline"><p>On Saturday, with classmates in a pseudo-LanParty, we completed Mafa Crazy TD with 5 out of recommended 11 players. There were 40 levels in total and completing it is satisfying. However, the end is a big anti-climax â€“ No save replay option and we didn&#8217;t manage to take a screen shot in time.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As such, we have proven that one does not need a full house to complete Mafa Crazy TD. Just team work and understanding of the game specifications. This formula will apply to any form of tower defence game.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Then, I opened a Standard Chartered Bank e$aver account after a long 2 hour wait.</p></p>
