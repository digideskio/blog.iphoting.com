<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;Your <em>attitude</em> determines your <em>altitude</em>,&#8221; I beg to defer with that quote. A more accurate one would be &#8220;Your <em>Thoughts</em> define your <em>Reality</em>&#8221;. This is also the basis for the phrase, &#8220;the strongest prison is not made of brick and mortar, but is made of thoughts that come from the human mind&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>You will become who you think you are. If you think you&#8217;re weak, you are weak. If you think you&#8217;re strong, you are strong. If you think you&#8217;re poor, you are poor. If you think you&#8217;re prosperous, you are prosperous. If you think you&#8217;re intelligent, you are intelligent. If you think you&#8217;re successful, you are successful. &#8220;For as he thinks in his heart, so <em>is</em> he.&#8221; (Prov 23:7)</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So really, as much as possible, think positive thoughts about yourselves and others. &#8220;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers.&#8221; (Eph 4:29)</p>
