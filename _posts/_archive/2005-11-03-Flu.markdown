<p class="whiteline"><p>My health has gone south and the Flu bug has caught up to me. My revision schedule has gone haywire. I&#8217;m in deep shit, thanks to diarrhea.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;m visiting a doctor tomorrow. If my health don&#8217;t get fixed by tomorrow, I&#8217;m seriously screwed big big time.</p></p>
