<p class="whiteline"><p>I envy people who have the great but despicable skill of shifting responsibility to others despite the obvious incompetence on one&#8217;s part. That&#8217;s a net debt of 40 minutes.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;ll be cool if I too could shift the blame of my mismanagement of time to the teachers or school for that matter.</p>
