<blockquote><p class="break">And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split. (Matt 27:51)</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This is the day, the glory of God was unleashed from the Holy of Holies in the Temple, into the hearts of men. It was only possible after the ultimate sacrifice was completed, redeeming us all from the sins that separated us from the most high.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This is the day the evil one worked to kill. Jesus descended to the dead, still preaching to the lost.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>This is the day that changed the world.</p></p>
