<p class="whiteline"><p>My experiences with meetings in this organisation has always been nasty. Although the protocol for running a meeting is well established and neat, the participants are annoying. In my honest opinion, many of the people who attend such meetings don&#8217;t spare much thought for others and are usually rather inconsiderate.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Despite having a clear agenda, people can still veer off-course and go on rambling on things which are irrelevant, wasting everyone&#8217;s time. Take the last one that I&#8217;ve endured as an example, the meeting was scheduled to begin at 4.30 pm ended up starting at 5.30 pm thanks to late comers. With no dinner nor night snacks prepared, people can still be distracted by minor matters, wasting everyone&#8217;s precious time. A simple 2 hr long discussion finally ended at 10.30 pm, exceeding the stated time by 4 hours.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I have to admit that I haven&#8217;t met everyone in this organisation, but from my interaction with people drawing a salary there, it is always negative. More on them in another post.</p></p>
