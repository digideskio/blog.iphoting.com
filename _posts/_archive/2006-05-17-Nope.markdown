<p class="whiteline"><p>I never wanted to not post lately but certain distractions and tiredness forced me to, unfortunately.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I wanted to talk about the new corporate t-shirts but I was too tired that day. I wanted to talk about the days of yore where a smashed car can be a welcoming present for a vice-principal. I wanted to talk about the bishop and why some questions aren&#8217;t just a question but more like a self degrading announcement on how shallow and unread one is.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yet, I got overly distracted by the budgeting for the soon-to-happen purchase of the Macbook. Making such a decision has always been hard but breaking my bank this time is for a worthy buy. Full justification and usage is available and hence, it will not be an unnecessary money usage. However, $1800 would take more than a year for me to refill my bank account to pre-purchase levels, given my current spending levels. Hence, to fully make good use of economics (that nonsense), I&#8217;ve decided to borrow money from my parents instead and reimburse them in instalments over a period of 18 months rather then paying through my bank account.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That means, I&#8217;ve got to live with a tightened budget and please don&#8217;t tempt me to Sake Sushi. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, there were a few annoying incidents that occurred. The fact that a new corporate t-shirt needs to be purchased despite my current one being in brand-new condition. The fact that I really cannot donate more to my 120 card as my budget for it has to be diverted to the corporate t-shirt. Though I agree that money generally comes (influenced) from the sky, (and laterally), but it&#8217;s not feasible for me to spend more than I receive.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As for the tests, I&#8217;m quite amused that teachers gave motivation talks, telling us that the exams will be kept to the circulum and that the test, chemistry especially, was a little on the difficult side.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;d glad if I&#8217;d passed my chemistry test.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another thing about IB maths that I like very much is that calculators are allowed to be exploited with whatever means possible to tackle the questions; including punching numbers into the calculator to generate a 6 mark answer. A great use of technology I&#8217;ll say.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, the school term is finally coming to a close. 1 more school week and it&#8217;ll be the four-week short summer break. I sincerely hope that I can clear most of my todo list within that period and at the same time, give my mind a much needed break from the daily routine and also, some fun that I&#8217;d missed ever since I entered sec 3.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh well, I&#8217;m off to look through a definition for the physics test tomorrow.</p></p>
