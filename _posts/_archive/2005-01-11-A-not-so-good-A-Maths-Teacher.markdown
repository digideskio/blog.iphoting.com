<p class="whiteline"><p>Heh. On Monday, our A. Maths teacher gave us approx. 21 permutation/combination maths questions to work on as homework. However, she demanded it today. With only a night to complete it, half the class didn&#8217;t manage to complete it in time. The other quater of the half copied it and the rest somehow managed to figure.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, punishment was to stand up during class and who knows what else. Well, due to the number of people to-be punished, she&#8217;d decided not to punish as it&#8217;ll most prob. be ignored. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, when this was done, she returned our Maths Journal. Those with folded pages are required to copy out a chapter from the A. Maths Textbook. The citeria for getting a folded page in the Journal is to leave it blank, formulas not included. So, she expected it to be filled with &#8220;notes&#8221; from her maths lesson. Common man, who&#8217;s to take down <em>notes</em> for an A. Maths lesson which currently consisted for something like a + b = a + b? No teacher has made note taking into a teacher-defined book mandatory, including E. Maths. This really pissed <em>everyone</em> off.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, when tempers flare and teachers get narrow-minded, it&#8217;s a cocktail for classroom disaster, which all ACS teachers would avoid at <em>all</em> costs. Well, fortunately or unfortunately, she suddenly withdrew all punishments and made us attach a feedback + way to improve her lessons behind our assignment which would be handed up the following lesson.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>A nuclear meltdown <em>almost</em> occured. I&#8217;m not gonna clean up the mess if it were to happen.</p></p>
