<p class="whiteline"><p>It seems like WWIII has started or is about to start. Just another spark at the wrong place and it will become an international conflict. It is said that the final war shall begin with Israel and its end shall be a dream.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Let&#8217;s count the concurrent issues:-</p>
</p><ol><li>North Korea needing attention; UN gave them limited sanctions, North Korea rejected within 45 minutes</li><li>War started with Israel, enough said</li></ol><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>From these 2, we can easily link them up to a few hands full of possible issues and incidents. As a whole picture, it isn&#8217;t something nice to look at.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If you think that&#8217;s nothing, remember remember, the United States of America and Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea are actually technically still at war.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Will the international community be capable of keeping and enforcing restraint and calm? Will this war end within 15 days?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This is the age of the Saints; when miracles happen. A time when &#8220;Thy kingdom come[s], Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Pray for peace, always.</p></p>
