<p class="whiteline"><p>The bomb shell has fallen, and it&#8217;d landed quite fine. Or at least, it landed where I&#8217;d expected it to, on the dot. Praise the LORD! <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>So here goes:-</p><p class="break">English - 76% - A1</p><p class="break">Chemistry - 75% - A1</p><p class="break">Physics - 79% - A1</p><p class="break">Biology - 74% - A2</p><p class="break">E. Maths - 86% - A1</p><p class="break">A. Maths - 87% - A1</p><p class="break">Geography - 68% - B3</p><p class="whiteline">Combined Humanities - 66% - B3</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Obviously missing from the list is Higher Chinese. You won&#8217;t need to know what I got, it&#8217;s history.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, L1R5 = 8 points, all thanks to Geography and my (realistic) target. With CCA bonus, 6 points.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I guess this should take me to the JC of my choice for the first 3 months. Now, I&#8217;ll have to ponder where I&#8217;d like to go.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>ACSi (IB), VJC or ACJC.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There are pros and cons here and there but I guess I&#8217;ll find the right balance soon.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Looks like I&#8217;ll have to start shopping for a nice laptop. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
