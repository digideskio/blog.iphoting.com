<p class="whiteline"><p>A departure from the queue of drafts to write this after reading an article that <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_174890.html']);"  href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_174890.html">NUS ranking dropped from 19th to 33rd</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m pretty happy about that though. I&#8217;ve had enough of their pompous and arrogant advertisement of how good the school is. If you&#8217;ve read the article, the NUS president in essence said that the quality is there, just that the methodology changed. If that&#8217;s the case, could students who have done consistently well in their school internal examinations, well above the entry requirement of the university, be granted admission despite doing poorly for the A Levels, because the bell curve got shifted? Looking at the way they present themselves, I&#8217;m willing to believe that they will grant no exceptions. Likewise, for their ranking.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What amuses me the most was that they did badly in the staff-to-student ratio component, especially when the government is wanting greater intake numbers.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Still, as I&#8217;ve always said, rankings don&#8217;t matter much. <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/mollymeek.livejournal.com/171053.html']);"  href="http://mollymeek.livejournal.com/171053.html">Here&#8217;s</a> another hilarious commentary about the world-class elite school of higher learning. Oh by the way, that (in)famous Dr Thio Li-ann is from NUS.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I hope I won&#8217;t ever have to end up there.</p></p>
