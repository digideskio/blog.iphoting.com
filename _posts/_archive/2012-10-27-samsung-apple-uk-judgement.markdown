Recently, Apple lost a design infringement case against Samsung and was ordered by the UK courts to post a notice on their site and media regarding Samsung's non-infringement, including the following paragraph:

> On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited’s Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple’s registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.

Apple duly complied with a [link on its site][source].

Not only did Apple include what the courts wanted them to as above, they went further and quoted from the case:

> In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:

> "The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design."

> "The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool."

Turns a "not as cool" statement into a marketing copy; I think it's simply brilliant and humorous.
