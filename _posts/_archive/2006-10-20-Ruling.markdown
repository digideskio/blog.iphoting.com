<p class="whiteline"><p>A 3 hour long Chemistry lecture is certainly some new heights we&#8217;ve gained in timetabling and work planning. Not to mention, the duration even exceeds most Universities&#8217;. At least, I&#8217;m glad that the notes are printed double-sided, one page a side, but the amusing thing was that there were no chemical models large enough to be seen throughout the whole LT. I suggest selling excessive brooms and dustpans to purchase a set of models for better visualisation during lectures.</p>
