<p class="whiteline"><p>From the passengers&#8217; point of view, driving has always been safe and easy, up until I have become a driver myself. Most of the time, passengers have no access to the minds of the driver while he is driving.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Over the past month, I have had thoughts such as, &#8220;that was close!&#8221;, and &#8220;a little more and I&#8217;ll crash&#8221;. Driving is, in my opinion, rather dangerous if the driver was distracted. Personally, I believe that as drivers, we go though many close shaves from accidents. The fact that an accident happens is because both parties reacted too slow or is not responsible enough in avoiding a crash. Oh course, there will be drivers who pass the burden of safety to other drivers by driving recklessly and carelessly.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;ll always be on a look out for dangerous drivers and stay far away from them. They are an accident waiting to happen.</p></p>
