<p class="whiteline"><p>This day, or yesterday rather, I was on the train and I saw an amazing sight. There were 4 elderly ladies sitting on four seats consecutively and at City Hall station, the crowds reached a neck choking level. 2 older elderly ladies came in and stood around the seating area.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The most surprising and the most, for the lack of a better word, despicable thing happened. Rather than the hordes of seated able-bodied people giving up their seats, 2 seated elderly ladies stood up promptly to offer their seats to the other 2 who just came in.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Unfortunately, I was standing too far to be able to encourage people to give up seats to those who needed them more than they do.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Watched Pirates and found the Dog scene a waste. Overall, 3.75 upon 5.</p></p>
