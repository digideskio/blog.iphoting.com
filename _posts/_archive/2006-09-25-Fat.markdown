<p class="whiteline"><p>This day witnessed the best demonstration of irony and hypocrisy in a real-life setting. I pity the trees that were cut down. I pity the people who inhaled the fumes from printing them. I pity that large amounts of energy is spent lighting up and cooling the new auditorium when no one uses it. I pity the ageing people who have to negotiate the light-years of red tape to do something trivial thanks to policies to prevent people from not knowing what to do.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>But, it&#8217;s a good experience. It has taught me what to avoid should I be in a position to do so. I doubt if I would be able to receive such education if for such a position that I am in currently, despite the overwhelming madness now, and that is to come.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I had managed to transpose the melody (or whatever the more appropriate word is) of &#8216;We Live in Singapura&#8217; from my mind onto notation form, finally. So amusingly, this is when I realised that next to my piano, there stands an electric organ (usually overlooked due to the difference in magnitude), which has an auxiliary sound output. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Oh my. That&#8217;s a whole new world of opportunities and the trashing of my plan to mic up the piano; tones without expressions will do for now.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Haha... Closer to it day by day.</p></p>
