New <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/imac/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMacs</a> at prices that I got shocked with. 24&#8220; iMac with Core 2 Duo. 17&#8221; iMac with Core 2 Duo at S$2000. I can&#8217;t believe it. Also, the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/macmini/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Minis</a> have been upgraded too.</p>

I&#8217;ve yet to successfully get Apple Qmaster working over a few Macs and hence, rendering times for scenes have been painfully slow. I hope this doesn&#8217;t kill my <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">Macbook</a> once again, especially with the amount of heat produced.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>At that, I really wonder what the 12th September Apple event would cover since all rumoured products got released earlier than anyone had expected.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Makes all my three desktops at home combined look really weak and slow.</p></p>
