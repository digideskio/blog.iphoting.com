<p class="whiteline"><p>Gave my Palm a new lease of life after the installation of 2 programmes onto it.</p>
</p><ol>
<li>iambic Agendus Pro</li>
<li>SnapperMail</li>
</ol><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I have to say that those programmes are really advanced and really worth the money. The desktop companion is excellent too. A good replacement for the Palm Desktop Software.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Next up would be completing my homework and studying as I&#8217;ve got less than a week left to those nasty examinations.</p></p>
