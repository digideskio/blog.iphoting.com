<p class="whiteline"><p>Wonderful day isn&#8217;t it? A day with breather for thoughts, a day with skimpy lessons, a day with verbal sparring during PC &#8216;lesson&#8217;. Various topics were covered, including overly severe treatment of little children, akin to killing flies with cannons. The teacher also generalised that the richer a person is, the more stingy he will become; and Bill Gates is an exception. This unexpectedly lead to a rather heated argument, especially when <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffet</a> isn&#8217;t exactly poor and he donated 85% of his fortune (which is quite a huge amount).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The teacher soon deviated the discussion to people who wanted to become politicians in the future and how &#8216;weird&#8217; GEP students think. Those topics, in my honest opinion, weren&#8217;t exactly the most politically correct ones to dwell on.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I find it extremely sad that there are teachers who, with their professionalism as they claim, criticise people who stutter when they speak. From the way the person got scolded, it seems as if <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/thomer.com/misc/stutter.html']);"  href="http://thomer.com/misc/stutter.html">stuttering</a> can be controlled and activated as and when the speaker wants.</p></p>
