</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m not pleased with certain people. My teacher walked into class today and started blabbering about the minority certificate issue and started asking us for our opinions. Upon attacking his ridiculous pro-establishment and copy-from-the-media views, he continued to go on repeating what our ranked 140th out of 167 media said. What&#8217;s even more surprising is that he insisted that the main reason for the press to blow up this issue was due to integrity of the candidate! What&#8217;s more, he declared that it&#8217;s pointless to have opposition for opposition. Might as well say that it&#8217;s pointless to have a parliament as everything is decided upon anyway, regardless of what the 2 opposition members say.</p>
