<p class="whiteline"><p>Happy New Year guys!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In a flash, a year is gone... 52.5 weeks are gone...</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What have I done?... Rather, have I done anything?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Hmm... Let&#8217;s see..</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Acadmically, I managed to achieve:-</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>3 A1s in Mid Year</p><p class="whiteline">4 A1s, 1 A2 in Final.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>CCA-wise, I dunno. The red tape kills to much time. I don&#8217;t see much done.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Programming-wise, I think I&#8217;ve completed a Staff Profile Index, a COMPSERV Attendance System (v3) and CyberAC Logging System. Also, some coding for LanParty - SG.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Knowledge-wise, a years worth. Books, no idea how many.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I think, that&#8217;s all.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If this goes on, my biography, if I or someone were to even write one, would be as thick/thin as guide to Democracy in Singapore book.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Anyway, I see more to come this 2005, I hope.</p></p>
