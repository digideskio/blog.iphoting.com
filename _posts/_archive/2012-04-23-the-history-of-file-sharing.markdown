> Last century filesharing was a fringe hobby, only for geeks who were lucky enough to own a computer that could dial into the World Wide Web. How different is that today, where filesharing has become daily routine for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In just a few years swapping files has become mainstream. Time to take a step back and see how it all came about.

A very interesting walk down memory lane on the evolution of file distribution networks. I still remember the days of 28.8 kbps modems; how painfully slow they were!
