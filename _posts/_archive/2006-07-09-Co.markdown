<p class="whiteline"><p>The Cow Shooters (TCS) <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/gameoflife.podhost.de/']);"  href="http://gameoflife.podhost.de/">have done it again</a> with the release of the second episode of their podcast.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I&#8217;ve learnt that &#8220;Your life is not shaped with your hands; it&#8217;s moulded by the hands of your company.&#8221; However, I makes me wonder if everyone has a liberty to go shop for friends. Is company created circumstantially or by choice? For one, &#8220;Good does not influence evil; Evil influences Good&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In something totally unrelated, the best time to fill cars with petrol (from the consumers&#8217; point of view) is in the night as petrol would not vaporise as happily as it does in the afternoon due to the heat. Also, it is pointless carrying a full tank as fuel would be wasted transporting the excess and unused fuel around. Thirdly, the boot is best left empty. Extra weight would result to extra fuel spent.</p>
