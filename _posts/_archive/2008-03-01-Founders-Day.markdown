<p class="whiteline"><p>I don&#8217;t know if I should be angry or happy. Maybe I&#8217;m happy because it&#8217;s the anniversary of the founding of the school, maybe I&#8217;m angry because things didn&#8217;t go the way I wanted.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I came to school with a few things to accomplish in mind. First of all, to collect my CCA record and my IB Diploma as according to the DP3&#8217;s email, &#8220;the IB diploma should be available for collection in February&#8221;. Well, the administration office staff claims that June/July would be a more probable date for the collection of the diploma. The next document available for collection is my CCA record.</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Despite having made and submitted corrections before deadlines and leaving school, I was still issued a totally blank and clean CCA record. The best solution the staff offered was to look for the CCA Director. This reeks of pure incompetence and negligence as I&#8217;ve found that a few other classmates too have a blank record. In spite of my contributions to the CCAs and claiming awards in competitions for the school, I have no official records of them; I&#8217;m certainly not going to submit the blank sheet to universities in my applications. Although I have a decent 2005 CCA record to submit in place, I find this incompetence and negligence (despite my earlier notifications) extreme peeving and infuriating.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Meanwhile, I shall ponder on my recourse.</p></p>
