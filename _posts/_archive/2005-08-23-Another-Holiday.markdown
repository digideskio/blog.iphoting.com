<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, we&#8217;ve got a holiday, thanks to the C division rugby guys who won my a narrow margin. Well done guys!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The start of my prelims is in 6 days, as of this writing, and I&#8217;ve got NSC competition on Saturday (27th August, 2005). What a mess! I should be at home studying and knowing all the properganda by heart. I&#8217;ve got to learn how to write essays according to the marking scheme. Yes, marking scheme; minimal writing, maximum marks.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve got to start planning for the subject combination for my A-Levels. I&#8217;ve been told <em>not</em> to take Computer Science as it&#8217;ll lead to a terrible class. So, I guess it&#8217;ll be Physics H2/3, Chemistry H1, Mathematics H2, KI H2-only or Computer Sciences H2-only or Economics H2.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Speaking of terrible classes, I&#8217;ve got plenty of, in fact, more than enough, experiences. From the worst to the best, I&#8217;ve been in one of them before during my short 6 year education career. Worst class in terms of behavior, academic achievements; best class in terms of academic successes and in spirit.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The blogging phenomenon is getting interesting. Revolution of communication means. From email to instant email then, web authoring. From web authoring to web publishing by the masses. It&#8217;s simply amazing. The world of bundled knowledge mess/mass. Where the quantity of mess/junk is proportionate to the number of quality articles. Search engines would have to work smarter, over and above working harder.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The charts or trees which show the relationships of each site is very amusing and entertaining. Based on links, the speak volumes of audience, author and the indexing engine.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m wondering if I should create a links block on the right for the benefit of the search engines and humans.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Darn. Time&#8217;s up. I&#8217;ll be off to study, once again. Gotta master relative velocity. It&#8217;s not difficult at all, in fact it&#8217;s fun.</p></p>
