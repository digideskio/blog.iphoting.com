<p class="whiteline"><p>Had 2 tests today. History and Social Studies. The night before, I managed to study and sleep at the same time and, still find the test easy.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, as for Biology test tomorrow, I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s that hard.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>One thing for sure is that the anime Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle has yet to vanish from my mind. I still think about it now and then. There are only 2 movies that had me think about them for more than 3 days. Namely, this and The Matrix(es).</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Looks like this anime deserves a 4.5/5 this time.</p></p>
