<p class="whiteline"><p>8 penalties versus 1 for us within the whole match, I seriously doubt if the opponents played a cleaner game than we did, or maybe the referee thinks differently. To think that they didn&#8217;t even attempt a try for 2 years is disgusting; a win albeit an embarrassing one.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Meanwhile, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/calendar.google.com/']);"  href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> is released! Finally something that I needed and wanted to work on is available properly on the net for free.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>After some testing, my jaw almost reached the floor. Its capability is so advanced that it superseded the PIM that came with my Palm and that of Agendus&#8217;. Now, the only barrier or limitation is that it couldn&#8217;t sync with my Palm out of the box. Looks like it can be easily solved with iSync + iCal, if it works as advertised that is.</p></p>
