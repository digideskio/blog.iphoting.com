<p class="whiteline"><p>3 weeks breezed by with such speed that it&#8217;s as if I&#8217;m on a space ship, travelling away from Earth, close to the speed of light.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It always humours me that Singapore as a knack for using nice sounding synonyms on things. For example, we have this thing called &#8216;June Holidays&#8217; which, in actually fact, is better known as &#8216;Mid-Term Home Studying Period&#8217;, according to one forum writer. Increasingly, schools are calling their term assessments a &#8216;common test&#8217; rather than the better known &#8216;examinations&#8217;, so as to portray the image that the school doesn&#8217;t have many examinations.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I guess, I&#8217;m best at procrastination, using my &#8216;holidays&#8217; from the back to the front, leaving the best for the last.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With a couple of projects and assignments requiring significant amounts of brain power, the following week would be a busy one for me, at the very least.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yet, there was one point that got proven this week. People from National Uniform Youth Organisations tend to like to speak loudly, disregarding the fact that a regular voice volume would get the message across as well. The downside of the former is that it will annoy people who can hear and most educated and intelligent people would find the speaker extremely disrespectful and maybe rude. Co-operation in any way is certainly to be met with resistance, passive or otherwise.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This also brings me closer to the belief that different types of UYOs, i.e., National vs. Association, produce people of different human interaction methods. National ones (no offence intended) tend to be more brainless and condescending while association ones tend to be more humanly and mutual. You are allowed to disagree with me here but that&#8217;s how I see it nevertheless.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On my walk around the net this week, I came across <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/alex.halavais.net/?p=1427']);"  href="http://alex.halavais.net/?p=1427">this article</a> on how to cheat well, written by a former educator. It is a good read for people who find plagiarism a common occurrence. After all, there&#8217;s an old slogan in academia, &#8220;Steal a man&#8217;s idea, and it&#8217;s plagiarism. Steal ten men&#8217;s ideas, and it&#8217;s a term paper. Steal a hundred men&#8217;s ideas, and it&#8217;s original research&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thinking back, I haven&#8217;t produced a single line of code this &#8216;holidays&#8217; and I&#8217;m beginning to suspect that my coding skills are rusting badly. I&#8217;ve got to speak OOP real soon. If not, it&#8217;ll be difficult to code something more advanced.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Also, check out my <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/del.icio.us/iphoting/']);"  href="http://del.icio.us/iphoting/">del.icio.us additions</a> as there might be something of interest to you.</p></p>
