<p class="whiteline"><p>Apparently, after my last post, I&#8217;ve learnt a lot. According to elerune, Speed of light is relative to gravity. Which means, if gravity is a variable, the speed of light would thus become variable. With varying speeds of light, everything based on it would too be variable. Just imagine how it&#8217;ll be.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Lately, there&#8217;s a certain person who is trying to dictate what I am &#8220;allowed&#8221; or &#8220;<em>not</em> allowed&#8221; to put on my site. Mind you, the internet is a realm for free speech. Who cares who writes or posts what. Who is one to govern what is or not to be placed up? Seriously, I doubt if sending emails to overloadedly busy teachers would change any single thing... It&#8217;s like complaining to your relative because you know someone who lives across town loves to sing a song which you hate. Whether it works, I&#8217;m waiting to see.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Today, there was a <em>major</em> bush fire really near my house. The haze is severe that the visiblity like 5 metres. Traffic jam and police and fire trucks crowd the field. Can&#8217;t really see the fire due to the haze.... The air stinks. Smells of burnt BBQ. Everywhere.</p></p>
