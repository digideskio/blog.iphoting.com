<p class="whiteline"><p>As I read the Straits Times today (only once a week if I bother), I came across a very amusing (sorry for the lack of vocabulary) forum letter.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break"><b>Nasty messages on T-shirts</b></p><p class="whiteline">I was offended by the messages printed on T-shirts worn by two young men in the Bugis Junction area two weeks ago.
</p><p class="whiteline">One message in bold lettering said: &#8220;I am surrounded by idiots.&#8221;
</p><p class="whiteline">The other message was a large picture showing the &#8220;third finger&#8221;.
</p><p class="whiteline">The men moved around with their girlfriends among the crowds with an air of nonchalance.
</p><p class="break">Such a scenario must surely be deemed an infringement of the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_legdisp.pl?actno=2001-REVED-257&amp;date=20051015&amp;method=whole&amp;doctitle=']);"  href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_legdisp.pl?actno=2001-REVED-257&date=20051015&method=whole&doctitle=">Public Entertainments and Meetings Act</a> by the police because offence messages were being flashed prominently by the wearers.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Reproduced without permission in full; Straits Times, 23 October, 2005.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It made me laugh out <em>loud</em>. The very citing of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act attracted my attention greatly. Of course, being curious, I&#8217;d checked out the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2001-REVED-257&amp;amp;date=20051015&amp;amp;method=part&amp;amp;doctitle=&amp;amp;segid=996552867-000360']);"  href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2001-REVED-257&amp;date=20051015&amp;method=part&amp;doctitle=&amp;segid=996552867-000360">definition</a> of the Act, i.e. Public Entertainments and Meetings. Despite my (somewhat) sincere scrutiny of the Act, I could not find a clause which deems such above-mentioned scenario as an &#8220;infringement&#8221; of the Act. The closest was found in Section 2 (1), 1 (c): &#8220;any exhibition of models, reading matter, pictures, photographs or of statuary or other forms of representation of human or animal figures&#8221;. Still, it has nothing to with the above, maybe with the exception of the &#8220;finger gesture&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, I do agree that the finger gesture is somewhat &#8220;offensive&#8221; to most narrow-minded and conservative Singaporeans, however, I find it very disturbing that such &#8220;minor&#8221; incidents of &#8220;expressions&#8221; require a letter to the press, over and above the more important issues of everything else, such as HDB policies and Civil Service &#8220;Customer Service&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On the other hand, I cannot find anything wrong with the T-shirt which has words in bold, &#8220;I am surrounded by idiots&#8221;. It is, to my (honest) opinion, a &#8220;self-fulfilling prophecy&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Let me explain. If you do not consider yourself to be an idiot, you would not be offended by that message as it would most probably only apply to the others that surround you, especially when it is written in such a general and humourous tone. However, you can only take an offence by the message if and only if you <em>agree</em> to it, right? So, by complaining about the message, one is essentially &#8220;admitting&#8221; himself to that of what the message protrays, in order to be &#8220;offended&#8221; by it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As such, the fact that people <em>do</em> take the message seriously really sounds like a joke to me and in itself. No doubt, I&#8217;d love to get such a t-shirt for myself (read: <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/frustrations/6b6e/']);"  href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/frustrations/6b6e/">ThinkGeek</a>). <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, there will also be people who empathise those mentioned in the &#8220;message&#8221; and try to &#8220;complain&#8221; on behalf of them, but such might result in negative outcomes, such as the further limitation of &#8220;expressions&#8221;. The word &#8216;expressions&#8217; was used instead of &#8216;speech&#8217; was so as to provide a more &#8220;correct&#8221; version of the statement. Freedom of speech <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> exist in Singapore <i>mah</i>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I just hope that the ST mailbox isn&#8217;t filled with all these types of non-important, aka useless, complaints.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Looking further down the forum page, I found the discussion on &#8220;Giving up seats&#8221; interesting too. There have been different opinions on the matter and I respect them. However, I do <em>not</em> respect the textbook response to the situation, if there&#8217;s even one.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In my (very honest) opinion, giving up seats on public transport to &#8220;those who need it more than one does&#8221; is something which is a decent act, <em>not</em> solely out of obligation.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, there should always be exceptions (in life). You may call me selfish or whatever after reading this but well, that&#8217;s just what I think. I believe that for my case, if I were to be seated (which is largly rare), I would offer my seat to those who need it more that I do <em>only</em> if the person who is to have my seat is accessible to my seat. If he&#8217;s across the carriage, or blocked by a blockade of (inconsiderate) people, I would not do so. As based on my past experience, by giving up my seat for a person so far away, (inconsiderate) people between myself and the person would take my seat instead, leaving me the agony of standing, not being able to help those who need seats, avoiding speaking french in public (in school uniform) and be more angered and annoyed by how gracious Singaporeans can be.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another exception would be that if I am felling unwell. It definitely brings no pleasure to have to endure the agony of the train ride, feeling sick and tired and in the worst possible case, faint and have nobody showing any grain of concern, much less a look.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Buf of course, I&#8217;ve also met nice and caring people too. Sadly, most of them truly are foreigners or educated. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/tongue.png" alt=":-P" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another more amusing &#8220;news&#8221; that I&#8217;ve read: <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/mitokondrion.blogspot.com/2005/10/smile-and-scare-tactics.html']);"  href="http://mitokondrion.blogspot.com/2005/10/smile-and-scare-tactics.html">Smile and Scare Tatics</a>. I ought to try them out one day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For those who don&#8217;t read the ST, check out <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.vainquer.net/']);"  href="http://www.vainquer.net/">Vainquer Teens</a>. It attracted my attention because a snippet of the (magazine&#8217;s publisher&#8217;s) beautiful letter on red-tape was published in the article.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I must quote, letter (e-mail) addressed to Dr Lee Boon Yang, Mini-star for MICA, from the ST (23 October, 2005):</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="whiteline">"The Singapore Government often calls for increased participation in entrepreneurship but with the multiple levels of bureaucracy involved, it appears to a certain extent contradictory for  so many levels of bureaucracy to hinder people from achieving their dreams.
</p><p class="break">I fully understand and appreciate MDA&#8217;s role in protecting the integrity of Singaporeans from negative influences but I find it vastly unfair for a magazine such as mine, to require such a long time to receive a permit."</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The key to cutting red tape, that is, writting <i>complaint</i> letters straight to the top, possibily getting the press involved.</p></p>
