<p class="whiteline"><p>YLS ah, what an event. First of all, have to congratulate the 1st SC for pulling it off rather successfully. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Nice RED lanyards.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It was a great day, meeting some really cool people and basically watching the various moot ministries getting questioned for their apparent incompetence.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The biggest take home element has got to be the speeches by the heavy weights, making the CEO sound weak and pale in comparison, especially his powerpoint slides that fortunately failed during his speech.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This succinctly demonstrated the importance of fast responsive personnel behind your back, making sure that hell cannot break loose and if hell indeed did break loose, there will be sufficient manpower to tie it back up. I guess, it&#8217;s always important to have a backup laptop <em>with</em> the content backed up on it too. It&#8217;ll be too late to say, &#8220;Oops, I forgot&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, the positive part is that it made the foreign participants less annoyed by the &#8216;reading-off-the-slides&#8217; presentation. Personally, I was sitting next to two of them and I can feel their annoyance radiating off their faces and bodies, whenever a speech is read off.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The speech and its delivery by the professor, blew me <del>off</del> away. It was very good.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The minister&#8217;s speech on the other hand when asked about Singapore&#8217;s Press Freedom was highly generic and scripted. One thing different is that he claimed that Singapore has unrestricted net access for people to get &#8216;whatever&#8217; information or news they want, such as from CNN or BBC. However, he kept pushing the point to adult magazines rather than business ones, like FEER.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Hehe.</p></p>
