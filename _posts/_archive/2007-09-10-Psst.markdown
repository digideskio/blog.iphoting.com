<p class="whiteline"><p>Today marks the first day of the preliminary examinations, which I find quite interesting. Instead of the usual, &#8220;which question did you do&#8221; questions, it became &#8220;Bird or Monkey?&#8221;. This was even more amusing as the first time this syntax was used occurred in the toilet, which drew quite some healthy laughter.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thankfully, the air-conditioning is rather reasonable, nothing colder than church, on this rainy morning as I forgot to bring along additional covers.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Still, nothing beats teachers kneeling in-front of the podium on the steps, counting papers, due to the brain-less design of the stage. It would have been the best photo opportunity had the principal been standing there. Even then, it makes good knee exercises on a cool Monday. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh well, tomorrow and the day after come the killer papers. I hope what doesn&#8217;t kill us can truly make us stronger. I mean, I hope we don&#8217;t die, never mind the stronger part. That aside, I like this <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/anonymousnoises.wordpress.com/2007/09/09/prayer/']);"  href="http://anonymousnoises.wordpress.com/2007/09/09/prayer/">prayer</a>.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>May the good Lord carry us through, amen. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
