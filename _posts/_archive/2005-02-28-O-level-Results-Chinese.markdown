<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, a day with quite a bit of nerve distrubance, is the day which my Chinese O-level Results are released.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Nothing spectacular but with the grace of God, I got a B3.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>At the LT where the results were released, a mix of emotions can be seen. Some worth looking, others better left to your wild imagination.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>All in all, I think the Chinese Paper was easy considering that I&#8217;d only answered <em>one</em> (1) question in the fill-in-the-blanks section.</p></p>
