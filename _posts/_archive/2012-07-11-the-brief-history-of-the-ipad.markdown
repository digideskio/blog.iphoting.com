> Apple’s tablet is not even four years old (think about that), yet its dominance and influence is global and undeniable. The iPad’s history is so incredible, that I don’t want to wait until it’s 10 years old to explore its journey.

The series is a work-in-progress, but still, a fantastic read of what's already published.
