<p class="whiteline"><p>What a cool name the International Baccalaureate (IB) &#8216;Vade Mecum&#8217; has, in Latin which translates to &#8216;handbook&#8217;. That&#8217;s what I found, the 2007 edition, while searching for EE rubrics through Google, the all knower of the internet.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Yep, you didn&#8217;t hear it wrongly. I managed to <em>see</em> a copy of the US$49 <!-- Google: "http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=en-us&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=vade+mecum+ib+EE+criteria&spell=1" Link: "http://www.mis-munich.de/resources/Academic%20Resources/TOK/vade%20mecum%20for%20IB%202007.pdf" --> Vade Mecum (2007) PDF available for download publicly on the internet, free of charge in its 476 page glory. Amusing. However, I won&#8217;t state how you can get it on this blog; I don&#8217;t condone copyright infringement. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Check the comments though, if someone is kind enough to let it slip.</p><p class="break"><!-- Let me know when you see this comment! =) --><!-- Additional Link: "http://www.mis-munich.de/resources/Academic%20Resources/" --></p><p class="whiteline">How amusing. This &#8216;handbook&#8217; contains all sorts of information that I think the school is trying to keep secret to us. Real deadlines, word limits, fees, implementation details, etc.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Great day today. Tomorrow would be as good if our SL2 period wasn&#8217;t taken up.</p></p>
