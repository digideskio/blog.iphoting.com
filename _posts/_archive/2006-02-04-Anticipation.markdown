<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;ve got mountains of homework waiting. I need more sleep. O-Level results would be (I heard) released on Friday. Wish me 7 points.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The moment I see next week coming, a few things flash through my mind. Firstly, exam results. Secondly, homework that&#8217;s due but incomplete. Thirdly, difficult budgeting. Forthy, very difficult people.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My target for the O Levels is to achieve a L1R5 of 7 points. Why not 6 you might ask. Well, 1 point leeway for whatever that might happen - Humanities. It&#8217;ll be great too if I could pass my Higher Chinese. I managed 8 points for prelims (after moderation), right on my target, and as such I believe that it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to achieve. With a single digit score, I can really thank God, continue receiving the ESIP scholarship and get a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/macbookpro/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a>. If not, I&#8217;m in trouble.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As for homework, I&#8217;m just a little lazy; I&#8217;m glad that I can finish all my homework by the deadline (for now).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Money-wise, I&#8217;m running thin. Books and Files, notes and what nots to be paid in cash, not to mention delicious food.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And very difficult people indeed. I&#8217;m sure most of you know who I&#8217;m talking about; the guy whos picture is plastered on EDMW and has pissed a record number of people off on first encounter. In law, ignorance is not an excuse. You can&#8217;t go to a judge and say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know this and this is wrong, so please don&#8217;t convict me&#8221;. And if you happen to miss a television show, do you expect the station to replay it exclusively for you? I doubt, but they do have repeats. If you missed a train, you don&#8217;t expect the train to reverse back into the station for you to board right?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, my point is that the result of incompetence and ignorance cannot be blamed on just incompetence and ignorance, but on the person itself. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t know&#8217; isn&#8217;t a justification, it&#8217;s a very badly canned excuse.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, don&#8217;t expect me to name names or I&#8217;ll be in trouble.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Meanwhile, the propaganda machine has swung into action; Singapore news papers have gone a little unrealistic - <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/02/good-news-tsunami-hits-singapore.html']);"  href="http://happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/02/good-news-tsunami-hits-singapore.html">Good News Tsunami Hits Singapore</a>.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>To keep my week ahead optimistic, Delirious? is finally here tomorrow. Can&#8217;t wait.</p></p>
