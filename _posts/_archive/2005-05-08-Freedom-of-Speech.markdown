<p class="whiteline"><p>Once again, the Freedom of Speech has been undermined. This can be seen easily through past news broadcasts and newspaper articles.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A piece of thought posted on the net being used as defamement for a certain subject is really appalling. As I&#8217;ve mentioned previously in a post named <a href="http://blog.iphoting.com/blog/archives/25-Disclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a>, blogs are just a place for thought and by no means intentional for slander.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The fact that the subject used legal means to counter a thought is really really uncalled-for. They could have simply countered the claims or launch a debate on the given matter. This really opposes the spirit of the Internet where information is distributed freely. Had they debated, they would win if they had enought merits, which I hope they do. This would put them in a better light instead of what they are known for currently.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty&#8221; - Wendell Phillips</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Looks like I&#8217;ve got some idea of what to study in future. Law. I hate it when one knows not of what others know, which they use to take advantage of one&#8217;s lack of understanding which, in turn make one go inline with others&#8217; (un)reasonable demands.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>There ought to be people out there who are capable of taking criticism and not respond with hostile actions, should criticisms hold no water.</p></p>
