<p class="whiteline"><p>The examinations preparation stage is here once again and it&#8217;s time to become unintelligent and succumb to the demands of the local education system, non-IB style.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Enterprise revealed to me a wonderful 3 week work plan for this important battle ahead. It&#8217;s simple. Get homework completed on the weekdays by 10.30 pm. Then, sleep all the way to 4.15 am and study from 4.30 am to 6.00 am. Then have a healthy breakfast with varying amounts of coffee, tea and milk mixture, configured for the day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, I would also power down my desktop and move it aside so that I get additional space to do work as TYSes and textbooks collectively takes up a lot of desk estate. With the space freed-up from the desktop keyboard and mouse and monitor combination, I can then house my laptop there.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Work ethics would also need to be changed. I will set aside at most 1 hour daily for emails and reading the articles on the net. Anything more would be snowballed to the next day or until the end of the examinations.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Meanwhile, I will create an examination revision timetable tailored for subject strengths and weakness and mental capacities of varying days. Sticking to it if Murphy is not around should allow me to achieve nice results that I once managed in Sec 3.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With these measures implemented, please accept my apologies for appearing and behaving less intelligently that you would expect.</p></p>
