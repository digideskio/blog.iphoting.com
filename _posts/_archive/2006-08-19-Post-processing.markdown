<p class="whiteline"><p>This day, I found myself chatting with ephemera about life and the cunning minds of chess players who get nowhere. Fear by the terrorists without even setting off a bomb. Lack of fear by press without pressing news. Oh how blissful people ought to be; the vicious cycle of the forms of government. Hitler&#8217;s rise and fall revisited. The question would thus be, which comes first, the end of a complete vicious cycle or the end of the world. The signs of the end times are glaring; it&#8217;s time to harvest all that&#8217;s left before it is too late - What&#8217;s the point of joining the winning side of a war when it&#8217;s over? It&#8217;ll be too late for war compensations.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yet, the bliss is a beauty. The island against all odds stand proud and strong. Oh well, oh well, how much time do we have left?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>&#8220;Live each day as if your last as one day you&#8217;ll certainly be right.&#8221;</p></p>
