<p class="whiteline"><p>As with my previous post pertaining to the thought experiment, the situation contains a valid contract. My point on lack of &#8216;due consideration&#8217; was invalid as person A <em>did</em> make a consideration by offering to pay, i.e. &#8220;Person A accepts product for any price under $10&#8221;. As such, the contract stays and that the shopkeeper A will have no right to demand for person A (once the contract is made) to foot the difference or to accept a refund, as contracts cannot be modified once made. In fact, it would look to be wrong for person A to return to the shop to foot the difference unless the shop agrees to it.</p>
