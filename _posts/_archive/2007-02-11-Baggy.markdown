<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, Church gave out <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cif']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cif">Cif</a> and sponge to all attendees as a pre Chinese New Year gift. I thought that was a marvellous idea, giving out something which is needed and used by almost everyone at the right time. It&#8217;s a great alternative to empty red packets which everyone seem to be giving out now.</p>
