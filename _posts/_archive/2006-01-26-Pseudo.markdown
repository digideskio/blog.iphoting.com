<p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s quite a huge difference between (most) IB and pseudo-IB teachers. From the way they teach to the type of homework they give; IB teachers tend to emphasize on the &#8216;process&#8217; or learning whereas pseudo-IB teachers concentrate more on the &#8216;outcome&#8217; of the learning. However, as always, what I&#8217;d mentioned in the previous sentences are <em>not</em> conclusive due to the small sample size that I&#8217;ve encountered.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For (a gross) example, my B&amp;M teacher started the class off without the intention of supplying notes right away. She split the class into groups and got each group to learn about a type of business, and then to present to the class. The final products from each group would then be compiled into a booklet as notes for the class. The contrary, the generic method is standard.</p>
