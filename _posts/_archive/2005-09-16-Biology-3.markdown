<p class="whiteline"><p>Had my Biology Practical today.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The specimen for drawing and observing is a raw fish head (thankfully dead) but bloody nevertheless. The question requests for the candidate to peel back the gill cover and cut it so as to allow it to remain open. Then draw an image of it with the gills exposed. After that, the candidate is to remove half of the gills and to deposit it into a beaker of water to observe the difference between gills that are immersed in water and those that are left in air.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To those of you blood-lickers, I&#8217;m sorry to inform you that handphones are not allowed to be brought into the lab and that no pictures depicting the bloody (not to mention, smelly) scene can be taken. If you&#8217;re really curious, buy yourself a can of tomato sardins and play with the fish there. If additional fun is required, feel free to visit a fish market and purchase one. Please note that a sharp knife is required.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>All in all, I think I did ok (A1) for the pract.</p></p>
