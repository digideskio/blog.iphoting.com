</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Was on a bus on my way home from the town&#8217;s bus interchange (waiting to turn left). Guess what, the bus (and many many others behind) I was on, was stuck outside the bus interchange due to a rather severe traffic jam. Can you believe it? Traffic jam at a neighbourhood bus interchange where it takes 30 minutes to move 400m? Having ERP gantries at the door of Tampines Mall is the last thing that anyone needs. There were like 10 over buses queueing to get in and out of the bus interchange at both sides of the road.</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today&#8217;s H. Chinese paper wasn&#8217;t hard. The comprehension and summary part I meant. Everywhere else, it&#8217;s another story. In the &#36896;&#21477; (zao4 ju4) section, I think the words recognised me but I didn&#8217;t know them at all. Yes I can read but I don&#8217;t get the intended meaning. A quick check with the rest of the level proves the same, with the exception of <i>Cheenas</i> of course. Another reason to hate them I guess.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I pray that I pass H. Chinese. 50% would do. Bah, 49.5% would do too.</p>
