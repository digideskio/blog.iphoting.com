> movies.io combines a pleasant and great-looking user interface with all the functionality needed to find and collect the best films out there.

In plain english, it's a torrent searching service for movies.

It has a fantastic interface which makes movie discovery a total joy. The only problem is that I can't pay for these movies. There just isn't an option available for international customers.
