<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve always suspect that I suffering from a certain degree of mental degradation, of which has been uncertain until now. Through this week in Hong Kong, I&#8217;ve experienced first hand my poor my memory has become; I could barely remember the way to the computer mall that I&#8217;d frequent â€“ I was guessing rather than recalling.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My just-in-time Mandarin to Cantonese pronunciation has degraded to such an extent that I actually had difficulty communicating with people.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What astonished me most was my game of DotA today. I don&#8217;t even recognise myself playing! I hardly know what to do with the shops, what recipies to get, and generally how to play.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Stunned and horrified, I decided that I must do something against this unfortunate side-effect of national service.</p></p>
