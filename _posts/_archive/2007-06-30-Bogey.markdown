<p class="whiteline"><p>I always find comments from youths (14-16 year olds) extremely amusing. They seem to have just the right amount of the lack of innocence, and at the same time, they do not have much psychological baggage.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Tabula rasa kind of response, the pure &#8216;innocence&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve got this little cousin who&#8217;s 7 years old with huge eyes and all. He&#8217;s able to use reverse psychology to please or curry favour somebody to do or get something for him. The things he say and look out for are absolutely brilliant. Sometimes, the obvious might just be the best answer.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The exams which whizzed by was quite an experience. Didn&#8217;t really prepare sufficiently but I think it&#8217;s suffice for a mid-year common test gauge.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Ok, I&#8217;m off to more sleep; I was sick with a runny nose on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing off most of my studying time for sleep, hoping to recover in time for the Thursday exams.</p></p>
