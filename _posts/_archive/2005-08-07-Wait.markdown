<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I (together with soneone) spent 30 minutes of my life waiting for people who were late. Not that I&#8217;m always early or on time lah, but being late for 5-10 minutes is fine by my book. 30 minutes is really a little long by my book... A sorry I&#8217;m late would be nice.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Seriously, I think next time, whenever there are meetings, anyone who&#8217;s late by 15 minutes and is the last will pay for everyone&#8217;s transport fee. I&#8217;m willing to bet that no one would be late, unless it&#8217;s due to unforseen circumstances.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Lately, my finances have turned into dark red. Not red, but dark red. Looks like I&#8217;ve got to reduce my expenses and increase my income, one way or the other.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve finally completed the 6th Harry Potter book. Sad ending. Very wasted. Nevertheless, I&#8217;ll wait patiently for the 7th book.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>National Day is coming up, have a nice weekend!</p></p>
