<p class="whiteline"><p>I shall share a short excerpt from what I&#8217;ve learnt from my pastor today. In a gist, with most biblical citations removed, he talked about &#8216;The Power to Validate&#8217;. It means that whoever that (first) &#8216;defines&#8217; a trend (or anything for that matter), he will be in a position to validate whether it is <em>it</em> or not.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For example (simplistically), if Georgio Armani declares that RED is the trend for 2007, probably the world would follow suit and design clothes with the colour RED in it as a design element. Clothes without RED might seem &#8220;out-dated&#8221; or not in fashion. Something along the lines.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s just like the iPod. Apple is <em>the</em> designer label for personal computing. Anything that Apple makes just looks beautiful, and naturally people would want to follow suit if possible. After all, &#8220;imitation is the finest form of flattery&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What this all means is that, a person of influence can make real changes in society, and people of influence tend to be in leadership positions.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, the question is, when you leave this world, what will people remember of you. What is the legacy that you will leave behind, and if this is your last day, is what you are going to do next worth it?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>In other news, one of the coolest pastor ever, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.syrogers.com/']);"  href="http://www.syrogers.com/">Sy Rogers</a> is coming to Church to speak next week. Can&#8217;t wait to hear his great insights and funny jokes. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
