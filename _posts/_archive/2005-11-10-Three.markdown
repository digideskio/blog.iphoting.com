</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Geography Paper 2, the thousand word essays one, was rather easy. Not much tricks but the mark allocation is somewhat worrying. Easy questions have rather high weightage; complex questions not so though. A2 maybe.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Biology was as usual. Much easier than the prelims too. I think I should be able to get an A1.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Tomorrow would be E. Maths Paper 2, which I hope it would be as easy as Paper 1.</p>
