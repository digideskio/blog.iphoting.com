<p class="whiteline"><p>Now, an aftermath of a disaster.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In the early morning, there was NPCC Day. Made some minor mistakes.. not too obvious I hope.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, lacking sleep and lacking practice, my A. Maths Paper 1 is seriously screwed. My brain has essentially shut down and my thinking and deduction processes are virtually inexistent.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Getting > 60% for this paper 1 is a miracle.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Geography paper was not as difficult as I&#8217;ve expected. Social/Properganda Studies would suffice in answering 50% of the questions. The other 25% requires knowledge on Economics and the rest, textbook knowledge.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>An interesting day.</p></p>
