<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m sorry to say this but being a Perfect 10 fan, I&#8217;m seriously disappointed with the new programme that they have arranged.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The selection of music that they broadcast during the &#8220;Say-it-with-Music&#8221; show seems to be older than my aging collection of mp3s. Therefore due to this, I&#8217;ve resulted to listening to my (huge) collection of mp3s instead as some of them are newer and to satisfy my listening pleasure.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My social studies teacher was right. The market focus has shifted and that the target audience have become those that are aged 30-40 years old. All thanks to the aging population in Singapore.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>As such, I&#8217;ll have to start hunting for a new local radio station which airs recent music. WKRZ comes to mind but I&#8217;ve yet to give it a whirl.</p></p>
