<p class="whiteline"><p>Quote from the New Paper (13th July, 2005):-</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">
&#8220;THE NKF&#8217;s patron, Mrs Goh Chok Tong, told reporters at the close of the case that she had complete trust in the organisation and its chief executive, Mr T.T. Durai.</p><p class="break">After the hearing, Mrs Goh was asked by reporters what she thought about the way the case went.</p><p class="break">She said it did not make sense to her to attack an organisation which helped the sick. All the NKF had wanted from The Straits Times was a retraction, she said, but the case had been extended to question NKF&#8217;s transparency and &#8216;expensive things&#8217;.</p><p class="break">&#8217;Why make a fuss out of it?&#8217; she asked.</p><p class="break">She said she would continue as patron, and added: &#8216;I have complete trust in the NKF and Mr Durai.&#8217;</p><p class="break">Asked if Mr Durai&#8217;s annual salary and bonuses were &#8216;excessive&#8217;, she replied: &#8216;For a person who runs a million-dollar charitable organisation, $600,000 is peanuts as it has a few hundred millions in reserves.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, I&#8217;m sure many average Singaporeans who (once) donated generously must be feeling very poor. Since $600,000 a year salary is considered peanuts, then what about those who earn $20,000 a year? Dust? Simple maths show that it&#8217;ll take <em>30</em> years for a person who earns $20,000 yearly to get $600,000. I really wonder what exactly are peanuts...</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Does having a golden tap fixtures improve rejuvenation? I think bathing in milk works better.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My A. Maths teacher has, for once, accurately stated that &#8220;for a person affliated with any organisation, his/her actions/words would be taken as that of the affliated organisation, unless otherwise specifically stated so&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I fully emphasize with those who thought that charity foundations ensure with maximum extent that the money that they&#8217;d received from gracious donors would be used for the cause that they have <em>advertised</em> for. Note the word advertised. Ever wondered where money for advertisments come from?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The major thing that many had agreed with me was that <em>transparency</em> is rather lacking in many establishments in Singapore.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, I&#8217;m glad that there&#8217;s a concrete justification for my reluctance to donate to that certain &#8220;charity&#8221; foundation. The amount of phone bills incured by them in their pleas for donations has put me off. Enough said.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My money would be better spent donations to some neutral organisation whihc in turn distributes to other organisations which are seriously in need for money and have no intention in misusing them.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Lying to get more donations is simply unacceptable in my book. This tantamounts to cheating, inaccurate advertisment, malice and possibily corruption.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With such amounts of cash reserve and the continued usage of such undesirable actions is certainly a call for concern to the educated and civilized.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I <em>strongly</em> prefer donating to KDF to NKF.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>P.S. This post is solely meant to express my thoughts and by no means intentional in promoting certain organisations over others. It is also not my intention to defame anyone and I  also believe that everyone should be given the freedom to donate to whichever charity organisation they like to as the money belongs to them.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>P.P.S. Should this post sway readers&#8217; stand against certain organisations, it shall be their choice in doing so and that I should not be responsible for it. Everyone is <em>supposed</em> to have a freedom of thought.</p></p>
