<p class="whiteline"><p>DotA, the game which I don&#8217;t really like at first, second and third sight, feels evil. It&#8217;s been eating people away and some of them have been lost within it. In better words of urshifu, &#8220;it destroys human relationships or degrades [them] significantly&#8221;. What trouble. The decay can be felt everywhere; it&#8217;s so prominent.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And it did take me a long time to find out why I&#8217;ve written ACSi as my first choice. In addition to my other reasons, something did start to stand out clearly. Within the mess there&#8217;s something wrong and I&#8217;m making preparations to avoid the brunt.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;He who walks with wise men will be wise, But the companion of fools will be destroyed.&#8221; - Proverbs 13:20.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That&#8217;s what I happen to come across. The problem is who&#8217;s the wise one and who&#8217;s not.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Communication is important. Misunderstandings are lethal. And instant messenging is dangerous as the tone is missing.</p></p>
