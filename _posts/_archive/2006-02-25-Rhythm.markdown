<p class="whiteline"><p><i>Vertical Horizon - Everything You Want - Finding Me</i></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As school goes into swing, just like engines reaching its optimum frequency, the momentum of the infastructure is starting to take its toll. Whenever Monday starts, with blues of course, there&#8217;s not a stop. It&#8217;s like a rollercoaster ride all the way down for the whole week, without any place nor time to slow down to see or think about what has passed or happened. It becomes like a cycle that&#8217;s painful.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To prove my point further, I&#8217;ve decided to rely on extremely reliabliable and logical mathematics. School starts at 7.30am and end at 4.40pm on 3 out of 5 days of the week. That would add up to 9 hours and 10 minutes, multiplied by 3, which gives 27 hours and 30 minutes. School ends at 2.40pm and 12.40pm on Wednesdays and Fridays respectively. That would lead to a total of 39 hours and 50 minutes, which does not include time for CCA, homework, traveling and eating. Let&#8217;s say I spend 2 hours daily on food and travelling, my total time for school would be 49 hours and 50 minutes. With CCA/CAS of 5 hours a week (very very generous reduction), that would be a total of <u>54 hours and 50 minutes</u> a week! Now, that doesn&#8217;t even include time needed for homework, life and sleep.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Since the last time I&#8217;d checked, the Singapore labour laws state that a regular work week is only <u>44 hours</u>!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To make the teachers seem more humane, I&#8217;ve decided that I only spend 3 hours a night on weekdays and no time on weekends to complete my homework and let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;m a genius and don&#8217;t need to revise my work. <u>69 hours and 50 minutes</u>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, how many hours left do we have in a 7 day week? 168 - 69 = 99 hours.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Hmm... I think I&#8217;m human and need to sleep at least 7 hours a day to maintain consciousness, so how many hours do I have left in a week? 99 - (7*7) = 50 hours, which amounts to 7 hours left per day! That&#8217;s the most conservative estimate.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>You may think that 7 hours a day is a lot, but let me assure you, it&#8217;s not when you add in miscellaneous time for doing what people in other parts of the world do when they have time after school, repaying sleep debts and not to mention, pursuing interests! How to live normal lives like that??</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>But hey, when projects pile in and homework loads further increases, I don&#8217;t know if I can even sleep and eat in peace. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Not bad, it&#8217;s only (69-44) <em>25 hours more</em> work/school hours than an average working Singaporean. How nice if I could claim over time pay for this.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That aside, I must be really lucky that I&#8217;d managed to find time for blogging. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It makes me wonder really, <em>why</em> does school-required-time need to <em>exceed</em> regular working hours per week by 57%. It would be nice if I can just be capped at 44 hours a week, inclusive of homework.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, this is Singapore, where the rat race never ends and starts way too early. That aside, a quick solution would be to just skip the homework and school while at it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That justifies why life is as or <i>more</i> exhausting than working adults, excluding teachers. At least, they don&#8217;t have a lot of homework to settle.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p><b>Update</b>: As per the first comment, I&#8217;ve learnt that students aren&#8217;t suffering much, when compared to teachers. Maybe that&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve got Teachers&#8217; Day, as with nurses and youths.</p></p>
