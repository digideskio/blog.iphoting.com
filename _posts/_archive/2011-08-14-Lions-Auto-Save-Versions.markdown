<p>For you new Lion users out there, you may have experienced the new File Management framework in-place within Lion in some Lion-enabled applications, such as Pages and Numbers.</p>

<p>With the introduction of system-wide Auto Save and Document Versioning, new terminology is introduced with respect to this new system. Rather than the decade-old and extremely familiar &#8216;Save&#8217; and &#8216;Save As…&#8217;, we now get &#8216;Save&#8217; or &#8216;Save a Version&#8217;, &#8216;Duplicate&#8217;, and &#8216;Revert&#8217;.</p>

<p>This new terminology is definitely confusing to those of us who are well-versed in the world of computing. To get up to speed with the new technologies that Apple is deploying, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/os-x-lion-auto-save-and-versions-to-the-rescue/']);"  href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/os-x-lion-auto-save-and-versions-to-the-rescue/">TUAW has a write-up on Lion&#8217;s new Auto Save and Versions feature</a>, and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.tuaw.com/2011/08/10/how-saving-changed-in-lion-inforgraphic/']);"  href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/10/how-saving-changed-in-lion-inforgraphic/">a pair of infographics</a> on the &#8216;<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/filesavebeforeliontuaw.jpg']);"  href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/filesavebeforeliontuaw.jpg">old</a>&#8217; and &#8216;<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/filesaveafterliontuaw.jpg']);"  href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/filesaveafterliontuaw.jpg">new</a>&#8217; file management systems.</p>

<p>Here, I&#8217;ll briefly explain how to achieve what you used to be able to do with the old system with new commands; <em>command mapping</em> in geek speak.</p>

<p>&#8217;Save…&#8217; is unchanged between both systems—a new file is created with the name specified in the classic Save dialog box.</p>

<p>&#8217;Save As…&#8217; is now replaced with two-steps—&#8217;Duplicate&#8217; followed by &#8216;Save…&#8217;. While this change may seem counter-productive, there&#8217;s actually a hidden feature behind the change. Should you forget to <em>duplicate</em> a file before making changes to it, selecting the same command after making changes will cause Lion to present a dialog box asking if you would like to 1) &#8216;Duplicate and Revert&#8217;, 2) &#8216;Cancel&#8217;, or 3) just &#8216;Duplicate&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8217;Duplicate and Revert&#8217; creates a new file with the changes you&#8217;ve already made and reverts those changes since last save in the original file. &#8216;Duplicate&#8217;, on the other, just functions like &#8216;Save As…&#8217; in the old system.</p>

<p>This actually can save you a lot of trouble from accidentally making unintended changes and having to transfer them onto a duplicate manually.</p>

<p>A new command introduced, &#8216;Save a Version&#8217;, creates a <em>snapshot</em> of the document at that point in time (without creating a new file), allowing you to revisit via the &#8216;Browse all Versions&#8217; interface. It&#8217;s great for bookmarking certain changes that you may want to revert, especially when you&#8217;re about to make changes  that involve data loss.</p>

<p>I hope this reduces agony during the switch to the world of Auto Save and Versions. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll never ever have to version my files manually by filenames in the near future.</p>
