<blockquote><p class="break">Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate,</p><p class="break">but that we are powerful beyond measure.</p><p class="whiteline">It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us.
</p><p class="break">We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant,</p><p class="break">gorgeous, handsome, talented and fabulous?</p><p class="break">Actually, who are you not to be?</p><p class="whiteline">You are a child of God.
</p><p class="break">Your playing small does not serve the world.</p><p class="break">There is nothing enlightened about shrinking</p><p class="whiteline">so that other people won&#8217;t feel insecure around you.
</p><p class="break">We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us.</p><p class="break">It is not just in some; it is in everyone.</p><p class="break">And, as we let our own light shine,</p><p class="whiteline">we consciously give other people permission to do the same.
</p><p class="break">As we are liberated from our fear,</p><p class="break">our presence automatically liberates others.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Sometimes when I feel like giving up, throwing in the towel, or kicking the bucket, I&#8217;ll always read this beautiful prose by Marianne Williamson and be reminded that we&#8217;re born to manifest the glory of God within us.</p></p>
