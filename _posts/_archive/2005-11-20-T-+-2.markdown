<p class="whiteline"><p>Apologies for my over-occupation on my examinations, post-examinations that I&#8217;ve not got enough time for sleeping nor blogging.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The Chemistry papers was a walk over (for me). I couldn&#8217;t spot trick questions for that particular paper. Anyway, (un)fortunately, I&#8217;ve found myself drinking Latte during every 4 hour paper intervals. Bad bad. Caffine is bad.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Upon dismissal from my Chemistry paper, the O levels have finally ended for me, not that I can feel it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Went to sls with classmates to check prices and drool at the Macs. I then, went to Breeks for dinner and Coffee Bean, Starbucks to kill time until 12.30am for the Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire movie.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Movie rating: 3.5 upon 5.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The following 2 days went in a flash. I was hardly at home anyway.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Went to the Flagship Apple Store to ask about the Mac Mini and to my surprise, the Mac Mini is <em>out of stock</em>! Shocking. Intel-based Mac Minis are really round the corner, so are the PowerBooks. Damn! No Macs this 2 months until the Intel ones arrive. Can&#8217;t afford to make poor-valued purchases.</p>
