<p class="break"><p>After looking through my palm todo list, it suddenly occurred to me that my domain is about to expire (September). This would set me back by US$9.20 for an extension of a year. On the other hand, I have some intention of getting another domain. I guess I&#8217;ll think about it when the timer starts ticking more loudly.</p></p>
