<p class="whiteline"><p>Ah, the end of a difficult subject - Social Studies. I guess almost everyone hit jackpot this time, with &#8216;The Rise and Fall of Vanice&#8217; as one of the SEQs (Structured Essay Questions). Grins and muted celebrations could be heard before the paper had even started. I guess, the bell curve would be a little odd this time, unless there are (as always) people who don&#8217;t bother to study. However, on hindsight, I found the phrasing of the (b) question somewhat strange. I guess that would be the gatcha for today.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The E. Maths paper 1 condicted 4 hours earlier, was a really easy paper. Much easier than the prelims, which was already very easy. This paper, IMHO, can be attempted with just an eye and half a brain (preferably the left), without any problems. Hands are required though <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> The bell-curve should look strange unless there are people who just don&#8217;t get Maths. Oh by the way, there were a number of well conceived and concealed questions. Those question look really normal and easy but the failure to read <em>every</em> word in the question would lead to a wrong answer.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For those who know what I&#8217;m talking about, I&#8217;m referring to the <em>prism</em> question. Half of whom I&#8217;d interviewed thought that object which water was filled in was a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid">pyramid</a>. Actually, it&#8217;s a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_%28geometry%29']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_%28geometry%29">prism</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Received the School Magazine and found ACJC missing! Well done, our school now occupies one whole magazine by itself. A likely reason for so many pictures of photographs of staff. I suggest that the school should have class photos for <em>all</em> year 1, 4 and 6 students. Give those who happen to be absent a chance to make a face on the magazine. Speaking of faces, the pictures filling the dividers within the magazine are very beautiful. Kudos to the photographers.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>But still, I like a combined annual all-school magazine. I guess, this would be my last book (10th) to my ACS School Magazine collection, assuming that ACS no longer becomes my first choice in my pre-university education.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With that, I&#8217;ve got to go rush my Biology and Geography revision, where the papers fall on the same day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Who knows, my memory is suprisingly powerful. I could recall most of the points in the Social Studies textbook and the array of notes the next day after reading through it once the night before. Thank God.</p>
