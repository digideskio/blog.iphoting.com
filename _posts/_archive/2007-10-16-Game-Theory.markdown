<p class="whiteline"><p>Some weeks back at cell gathering, we played this interesting game.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The game master is the banker. For the purposes of the setting and the number of people available (insignificant to the theory), we were split into 5 groups, and each group is given an envelope with the names of the group members written on it. The groups are then separated such that any form of communication between them is not possible nor allowed. The groups are to then, at their own independent discretion, place an amount of money into the envelope and hand it to the banker as payment.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The banker will reimburse exactly $10 (regardless of how much groups gave) to each group, if and only if, the total amount of money collected from the groups <em>exceed</em> $37.75. Any less, the money from the groups will be forfeited and no $10 reimbursed.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As such, if you were one of the groups, how much money, and why, would you put into the envelope for maximum gain from the banker?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Think up an answer and a reason before looking into at the comments (if any) and posting yours.</p></p>
