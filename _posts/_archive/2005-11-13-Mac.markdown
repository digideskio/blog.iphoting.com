<p class="whiteline"><p>After some thought today, I&#8217;ve decided to get a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com.sg/macmini/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com.sg/macmini/">Mac Mini</a> <i>first</i> before I get a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com.sg/powerbook/index15.html']);"  href="http://www.apple.com.sg/powerbook/index15.html">15" PowerBook</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As the specifications are somewhat similar, a Mac Mini would allow me to experience a PowerPC-based Mac with a low upfront investment, i.e. S$1,100 instead of S$3,400. Furthermore, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1368']);"  href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1368">reliable sources</a> mentioned that Intel-based Macs, more specifically the iMac and PowerBooks, would be released around January, 2006.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, I just sell off my computer for $800 and use that plus a little top-up to buy the Mac Mini.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today&#8217;s service in Church was somewhat not too conventional. At least, I didn&#8217;t felt that the sermon was complete.</p>
