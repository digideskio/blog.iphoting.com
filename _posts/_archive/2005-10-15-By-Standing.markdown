<p class="whiteline"><p>Dedicated my presence to VJC this morning. Sad to say, as a former student in ACSi, I can hardly be amused by any facility nor equipment showcases. In short, only Universities or Polytechnics can attract me based on the above. As such, I&#8217;ll not dwell on facilities/equipment or the lack thereof. The one thing which I&#8217;ve yet to come to terms with is that air-conditioning doesn&#8217;t exists <i>everywhere</i>... heck.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Learnt about the subject combinations there. From that I&#8217;ve heard, KI, Knowledge and Inquiry, is a very interesting or somewhat fun subject; it somewhat resembles the well-(known|hated) TOK in IB, just at a simpler and more suicidal level. 1 and only <em>one</em> consultation for a individual project for the last half of year 2. It&#8217;s like driving with opaque windscreens where the only chance to study the road is the time before entering the vehicle. Oh yah, did I mention that the vehicle has no brakes? Anyway, I hope this subject can tickle, not burn my mind at the right places. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>After listening to subject briefing by people, I&#8217;ve decided to <em>drop</em> Computing for Economics. I know it&#8217;s a more-than-suicidal choice but it&#8217;s necessary to just satisfy the &#8220;holistic education&#8221; aspect of MoE policy.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, my (final) subject combination, if my grades allow me:-</p>
</p><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Subject</th></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Mathematics</td></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Physics</td></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Chemistry</td></tr><tr><td>H1</td><td>Economics</td></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Knowledge and Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>H1</td><td>Project Work</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right">10 Points</td></tr></table><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Note: MTL (Mother Tongue Language) is intentionally left out, thanks to my HCL.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Economics over Computing has been a difficult choice especially when most people commented that Economics is a subject where it <i>seems</i> like common sense but is no where near it. The main reason is due to a lack of hours in a day for me to pursue such a &#8220;heavy&#8221; subject combination. Time tables are already long, making it any longer would be bad for health, in all aspects. On the other hand, the Computing syllabus, to my surprise, looks boring. I&#8217;ll be better off with self-paced learning, I guess.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Living without mental stimlus for the past 2 years have been a great torment. Imagine, for the full 600 (or more) days, no one (with the exception of 3 in my class) has been capable of participating or initiating intellectual discussions, much less sustain one. With syllabus that even the adjective, boring, is an understatement, I believe my mind has decayed very much. Talk about something out of this Earth and I&#8217;ll need to strain my mind (more than before) to catch and anticipate your ideas.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My chain or creation of thought has slowed so much (as compared to my second year in school) that I don&#8217;t think I can be in any OM spontaneous team without causing a rethink to their point-gaining strategy.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, no point moaning over spilt milk, I&#8217;ll shall hope that the new level of education would not be as disappointing as the current one.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Having heard of the (Micro)Biology syllabus, I feel tempted to offer it. But still, I retain my stand that Biology education (O Level) is boring and a complete waste of time, unless you desperately need a A1 for your sciences. If not, you&#8217;re better off sleeping with the free time.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, don&#8217;t ask me about the VJC campus, you&#8217;ll know more about it in due time.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Apparently, God didn&#8217;t tell me to fill up and submit the IBDP application form. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> So, it&#8217;s no longer a choice for me to &#8220;consider&#8221;. For good I believe. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
