<p class="whiteline"><p>Good news that I&#8217;ve got this week are quite plentiful. Most significant of all is that I received 33 upon 40 for Aural-Oral. Top-in-class for a person who don&#8217;t find immense pleasure in speaking and has got inaccurate intonation, To God be the Glory.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>No cross country. Yeah! Thanks to the rain. Had the whole afternoon (literally) free.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, the student interaction forums picked up pace and had many active people. Constructive comments were heard and the snr admin no longer has the right to say &#8220;no feedback received&#8221;. It&#8217;ll just reflect how receptive the snr admin is towards comments.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve also heard that the whole you-know-what saga was actually a political thing. Not really because of the corrup.. ahem.. tion but something bigger.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Shockingly, the prelims are just 3 weeks away and I&#8217;ve yet to feel the steam.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, I got a ticket to the &#8220;Let The Good Times Roll Country Rock &amp; Roll Charity Music Festival&#8221; at the Padang. Hope I won&#8217;t have to waste my time there. Though, I would rather spend my time at FoP (Festival of Praise) than this anyway.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Take care!</p></p>
