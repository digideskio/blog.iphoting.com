</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yep. That&#8217;s it. No &#8216;from&#8217; address as I didn&#8217;t receive it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, from what you see above, tell me if the offer is real or is a hoax.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today&#8217;s catch consists of, a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/justsomegibberish.blogspot.com/2005/11/funny-exam-answers.html']);"  href="http://justsomegibberish.blogspot.com/2005/11/funny-exam-answers.html">post on funny exam answers</a>, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2457']);"  href="http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2457">the mind of a chess player</a> (which is somewhat reflective of mine while completing examination papers) and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/jokerus2001.blogspot.com/2005/11/school-conspiracy.html']);"  href="http://jokerus2001.blogspot.com/2005/11/school-conspiracy.html">something on school conspircy</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And, a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;output=html&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;q=1+Broadway,+New+York,+NY+10004']);"  href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;output=html&amp;btnG=Search&amp;q=1+Broadway,+New+York,+NY+10004">hint</a> to whether the above email &#8216;offer&#8217; is real or a hoax.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Post what you think in the comments. Reasons would be nice to document your direction of thought. I&#8217;ll post my analysis soon (read: tomorrow).</p>
