<p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this piece of software, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html']);"  href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a> (Mac only), which is of great help to me while working on papers which have multiple sections, like EE or my Business IA.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This software specialises in just letting the user pen down thoughts, ideas and just content, doing the brunt of the formatting work right at export.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With this, it took me only a couple of minutes to format my EE to be printed.</p></p>
