<p class="whiteline"><p>As expected, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has released a brand new <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/macmini/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>, featuring Intel Core Duo and Core Solo. With additional USB ports, this product is much more usable; it&#8217;s at its same low price too!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yesterday, I managed to get my hands on a old 400MHz PowerMac G4. Yes, I have to agree that 400Mhz is a tad low these days, but this machine never failed to amaze me, given its age of 5. A DVD reader; ADC which looks like a DVI connector; and stability. It&#8217;s on Mac OS X 10.2 for now and I&#8217;m looking for ways to up it to 10.4, but first converting dmg to iso.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Somehow, that machine is capable of multitasking better than a 500MHz Windows machine. It&#8217;s said that the Mac OS is highly inefficient and thus it might imply that a 400MHz PowerPC G4 might just outperform their x86 counterparts.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I feel like buying one of these cheap to play with.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A day of rest has gone, looks like it&#8217;s back to work, again.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I remember that I had something blog worthy but I&#8217;ve forgotten about it... and I still couldn&#8217;t recall what it is.</p></p>
