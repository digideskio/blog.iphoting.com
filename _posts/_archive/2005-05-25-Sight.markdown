<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m starting to lose myself. My actions seem to cause trouble and at the most untimely moment. My foresight seem to be fading. I&#8217;m getting myopic and exhausted, both mentally and physically.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Life can be tiring and sometimes overly predictable. However, there are also times where, according to Murphy&#8217;s law, everything that can go wrong will go wrong.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>These days, a test of mental stability, on-the-spot thinking and plan B execution. A great learning experience but extremely bad for health. Possibly a catalyst for heart attacks and early death; mental trauma and brain wacking sessions.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I won&#8217;t mind experiencing these occassionally but the fact that I&#8217;m seeing these almost week after week is getting on my nerve. I&#8217;m getting tired and I&#8217;d love to live a carefree life that most advertisements show.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s the other side of the coin but I&#8217;m too skeptical to believe that a coin has only 2 sides. I think it has 3 sides, or more. The heads, the tails and the circular side which arguably has approxmately infinite sides.</p>
