<p class="whiteline"><p>The second day of my exmainations. English Language.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The first paper was an eye opener. Speech (which I&#8217;d predicted, together with formal letter) came out for the functional writing section. It was rather exciting considering that the one word topic in section one was &#8216;Marriage&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, writing an expository essay on something that I&#8217;ve yet to experience is not exactly the best thing to do in an International Examination. So, the next best course of action for me was to attempt question 4, where it states that the choice of a career is the most important one, what are the factors that will influence your choice.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Paper two on the other hand was fairly predictable. I&#8217;ve counted and 15 content points in my summary and I hope I get greater than 20 marks for that section (max 25).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I must get an A1 for English, or there goes my L1R5 target.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Next up, Geography Paper 2 and Biology. The top two subjects in terms of content knowledge requirements (aka mugging).</p></p>
