<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My trip overseas was difficult, not in terms of unfamiliarity with the terrain or conditions as I&#8217;ve been there before, but in terms of my mental health. Being trapped in the desert with such boredom, having hardly anyone to converse with intellectually almost drove me into the abyss.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Fortunately for me I could still think logically and that wireless internet connection was available via social engineering and thus I remained sane. Reading is hardly possible as the conditions were not suitable â€” I did finish half a book though.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Even through all these, I felt God with me, carrying me through with his Love; the joy in Him is my strength.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m back. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The song by Hillsong, You Hold Me Now, reveals his Glory and His new Kingdom.</p>

</p><blockquote><p class="break">On that day when I see</p><p class="break">All that You have for me</p><p class="break">When I see You face to face</p><p class="whiteline">There surrounded by Your grace
</p><p class="break">All my fear is swept away</p><p class="break">In the light of your embrace</p><p class="break">When Your love is all I need</p><p class="whiteline">And forever I am free
</p><p class="break">Where the streets are made of gold</p><p class="break">In Your presence healed and whole</p><p class="whiteline">Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone
</p><p class="break">No weeping, no hurt or pain</p><p class="break">No suffering You hold me now</p><p class="break">You hold me now</p><p class="break">No darkness no sick or lame</p><p class="break">No hiding You hold me now, </p><p class="whiteline">You hold me now
</p><p class="break">In this life I will stand</p><p class="break">Through my joy and my pain</p><p class="break">Knowing there&#8217;s a greater day</p><p class="whiteline">There&#8217;s a hope that never fails
</p><p class="break">When Your name is lifted high</p><p class="break">And forever praises rise</p><p class="break">For the glory of Your Name</p><p class="whiteline">I&#8217;m believing for the day
</p><p class="break">When the wars and violence cease</p><p class="break">All creation lives in peace</p><p class="whiteline">Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone
</p><p class="break">No weeping, no hurt or pain</p><p class="break">No suffering You hold me now</p><p class="break">You hold me now</p><p class="break">No darkness, no sick or lame</p><p class="break">No hiding You hold me now, </p><p class="whiteline">You hold me now
</p><p class="break">For eternity</p><p class="break">All my heart will give</p><p class="whiteline">All the glory to Your name
</p><p class="break">No weeping, no hurt or pain</p><p class="break">No suffering You hold me now</p><p class="break">You hold me now</p><p class="break">No darkness no sick or lame</p><p class="break">No hiding You hold me now, </p><p class="break">You hold me now</p></blockquote>
