<p class="whiteline"><p>The burden is heavy. Some collapse, others scream out in pain. Crushed, mindless... Painful. The never-ending vicious cycle which can only get worst as time passes. Red paint, spilled all over. Messy, I&#8217;ll say.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Some say time will heal; I think not. Letting time pass would snowball its might. Before long, one would cease to see the value of light and choose to look back, wasting all his time away. However, doing so would only make matters worst. Moreover, there are the by-standers who know not of what they ought to know and commit misdeeds which are burdensome.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Who knows, the weather favours nobody either.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There are really only three types of people: Those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who say, &#8220;What happened?&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Who are you and who do you like to be?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Some food for thought:-</p><p class="break">&#8220;Everything is o.k. in the end. If its not o.k., then its not the end.&#8221;</p></p>
