<p class="whiteline"><p>I don&#8217;t really like Singapore politics but somehow, things around me seem to just get on my nerves. I find it extremely to abstain from reading any form of local news papers. It somehow makes me detached but at the same time, reduces my blood-boil opportunities.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yet today, I&#8217;ve got something to say still.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">To anyone who actually believes that James Gomez is dishonest and a liar etc.. I suggest that you attend the WP rallies and listen to what they have to say, instead of relying on the media for information. Please do remember that this is the media ranked 140th out of 167 in the world.</p></blockquote><p>

A quick and easy way to see what their limited weapon choices are.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For some humour, check out Lucky Tan&#8217;s post on the certificate business <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/05/gomez-gomez-gomez.html']);"  href="http://happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/05/gomez-gomez-gomez.html">here</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I find it more and more amusing and absurd that failing to submit a form could equate to something as grave as discrediting the electoral process in Singapore. In the first place, what &#8216;credit&#8217; left is there for them to defend the process so vigorously? Moreover, that analogy is like having students who don&#8217;t submit homework in time be accused of discrediting the education system or the mini-star himself; which I don&#8217;t exactly mind in this particular case. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>WP ought to win 1 SMC and 1 GRC. SDA ought to win 1 SMC and hopefully Tampines GRC too. This way, with 12 opposition members in the house, transport fares would need some intensive debates before being allowed to be raised. If not, it would be dark times; terrible times with wonderful price hikes that even the progress package cannot sustain.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With fuel prices inching to US$100 per barrel, I wish everyone all the best and God Bless. Starving together, moving ahead, I hope wouldn&#8217;t happen in widespread proportions.</p></p>
