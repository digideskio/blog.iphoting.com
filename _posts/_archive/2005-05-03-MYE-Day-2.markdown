<p class="whiteline"><p>Had my English Paper 1 and E. Maths Paper 1 today.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As for my Essay, I wrote about Dreams. Which I&#8217;d to admit that it&#8217;s very easy and there&#8217;s lots to write about.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For the E. Maths Paper 1, I found it the most exciting one for this term. Interesting questions where memory work is unnecessary. Time management too is a crucial thing.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A question which had appeared on the paper:-</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><div class="serendipity_imageComment_center" style="width: 250px"><div class="serendipity_imageComment_img"><img width='250' height='344' border='0' hspace='5' src='http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/uploads/School/MYE-E-Maths-Circle-Radius.png' alt='' /></div><div class="serendipity_imageComment_txt">Find the radius of the Circle</div></div>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s quite an easy question to answer with hindsight... No prizes for the right answer though. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I think I can get some decent marks for these 2 papers. Not sure about S. S. tomorrow though...</p></p>
