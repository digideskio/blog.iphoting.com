<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, is the day of my Physics Paper 3 examination. I&#8217;m in the second shift, which IMHO is the best.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s a certain degree of unfairness within the setup as many agreed with me.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There are 2 sections to this paper. Section A and Section B.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It takes approxmately 40 minutes to complete Section A whereas only 25 minutes are required for  Section B. Half the candidates take Section A first and the other half take Section B.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The examination lasts for 1 hour and 30 minutes. After the first 45 minutes, a swap will be done. Meanwhile, you can still complete your question paper no matter which Section you are at.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, here&#8217;s the thing. People who started with Section B would be able to complete a section of the Paper with 20 minutes or so spare. People who started with Section A however would be able to use a large part of the 45 minutes allocated as the Section A required a lot more time.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>After the switch, people who had Section A first would then be able to finish up Section B quickly and return to complete Section A. However people who had Section B first would not have the additional time that the other batch of people would have, making this a real time management test.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;d managed to complete the paper <em>in</em> time. Well, I realised after the exam that I used the wrong method to measure the diameter of a beaker....</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh well, it&#8217;s only 2 marks.</p></p>
