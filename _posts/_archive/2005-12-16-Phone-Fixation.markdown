<p class="whiteline"><p>I wonder...... What exactly is being considerate. An interesting incident occured on the train.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I was seated on the seat with my bag on my lap and my Palm (PDA) and hand phone on my bag. Standing up immediately with such an arrangement is impossible without things falling off (in other words, impossible).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I was on my way to Wisma to have my phone repaired due to the hanging bluetooth problem. On the train, i was testing out all possible ways to hang the phone and wasn&#8217;t entirely conscious about the surroundings.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>At a certain station (I wasn&#8217;t really paying attention), two elderly ladies entered the carriage (I&#8217;ve yet to know then). By the time I looked up from my Palm handheld, the lady (approx. 5 years older than I am) stood up to offer her seat to one of the elderly ladies. Another person diagonally opposite my seat gave up his/her seat for the other old lady. All these happened really quickly before I could pack my stuff which were scattered on my bag.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The amusing thing is that the lady who gave up her seat next to me stared at me as if I &#8216;was very inconsiderate&#8217;. Yes, I would like to give up my seat, just that given that particular circumstance, I wasn&#8217;t fast enough. 2 stops later, many people alighted and there were plenty of seats available for anyone who was standing. Amusingly, the &#8216;generous&#8217; lady didn&#8217;t take a seat despite excess available. So, my (intentionally shallow) conclusion is that she loved standing...makes me wonder why she took a seat in the first place.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>At the Sony-Ericsson service centre, queued for an hour plus to get to a customer service officer. Told the lady about the bluetooth problem. She offered to flash firmware (their only solution, I guess). But they can&#8217;t do it there and then due to apparent &#8216;server downtime&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>She offered two suggestions:-</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>1) Come back another day;</p><p class="whiteline">2) They would give me a call when my phone is ready.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Apparently, option 1 is not an option, and I started at the lady. Something along the lines of without a phone how do I receive phone calls. She kindly checked if they&#8217;d phones available for loan after my &#8216;gentle&#8217; request for one. I&#8217;ve no idea where (un)common sense has flown to. Or maybe it&#8217;s just an exclusive service to certain types of relatively more demanding &#8216;customers&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whatever.. Then, on the way to Borders, I unexpectedly met freestylerx. At the Borders information counter, I handed a neatly and meetly printed list of books that I&#8217;ll need for next year. To my non-delight, <em>NONE</em> was available in Borders.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>At Kinokuniya, there were only Science books available. Everything else was not available. Looking at the shelves that the assistant handed us (me and freestylerx), we found only the Chemistry and Physics books. The Biology book available is one revision newer then requested for.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Jon Wong came soon enough and we wondered for food. Apple products were then scrutinised.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, I&#8217;ll end up going home empty handed (no books to buy anyway), stomach filled with Pepper Lunch. What an economical and good place for food, regardless of the time.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And to my surprise, the Biology spotted us.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>As for the NIRC thingy, with only 2 numbers and an ending alphabet, I could generate 9091 possible combinations of numbers. This shows that the modulus (%) operator is a many many to one operator. Going backwards is really not feasible.</p></p>
