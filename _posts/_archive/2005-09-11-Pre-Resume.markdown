<p class="whiteline"><p>On Monday, it&#8217;ll be Physics Paper 1 and Paper 2 (Paper 3 is over), followed by Geography Paper 2. Geography Paper 2 is also known as the paper where the candidate spends 2 hours and 15 minutes, generating essays, each of approxmately 300 words each for each (part)question. There are about 5 questions with about 5 part questions each.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>That makes 25 300 word-long essays. In short, a (well-prepared) candidate would need to write about 7500 words.</p></p>
