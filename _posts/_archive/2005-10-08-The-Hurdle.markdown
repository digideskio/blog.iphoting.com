<p class="whiteline"><p>Spent the whole of yesterday day afternoon and night, studying my pre-university education paths and choices.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Through (un)informative MoE and school websites, I&#8217;ve learn quite a few things. The most important (for me) is that &#8220;achieving&#8221; D7 and better in Higher Chinese, would allow me to be exempted from the wretched Chinese Language in JC. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I hope this applies to the L1R5 bonus points too.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Looks like I&#8217;ve narrowed my pre-university choices from 3 to 2 now, i.e. VJC or IB, in order of &#8220;merit&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Apparently, IB isn&#8217;t too much to my favor due to numerous reasons, such as my lack of Lit exposure. Feel free to persuade me otherwise however.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Should no substantial points for IB be placed forward, I guess my choice (as above) should be almost final.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Having looked through my O level examinations time table, I almost have a shock of my life. I&#8217;d always thought that the prelim examinations timetable was unreasonable but as always, the worst is yet to come. Or in the words of Murphy (Law), &#8220;everything that can go wrong, will go wrong&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I have 3 days in which I have at least 3 papers to sit for. In 2 out of the 3 days, I have heavy content papers, stacked back to back. On the 10th November, I&#8217;ve got Geography paper 2 (the thousand word essays) with Biology paper 1 and 2 in one day. 16th November, Geography paper 1 with Physics paper 1 and 2 in the same day. The master of all bad timetables, 18th November. I&#8217;ll have History, followed by Chemistry paper 1 and 2. The day would start at 8am and end at 6pm for me, longer than normal 9am to 5pm working hours. Working is tough, taking examinations is tougher.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Even if my arms/wrists don&#8217;t get tired from writing the many foot-long essays, my mind would be exausted from the examination conditions for the <em>whole</em> day, not to mention the freezing air-conditioning.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m just one step short of speaking or penning letters in french to the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>But well, fear not as &#8220;Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.&#8221; - Isaiah 40:30-31.</p></p>
