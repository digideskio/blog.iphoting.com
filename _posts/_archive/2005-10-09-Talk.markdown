<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, after service, had lunch at Mos Burger with cell. There, I believe, I&#8217;d the most or one of the most intellectual discussion of this year. We talked about the &#8220;Begining of the World&#8221; theory which eventually led to the Relativity Theory and Special Relativity. And we wondered how scientists measure how distant stars are, or how (in)accurate their predictions or estimations are.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Once I&#8217;d got home, I took a peek at the news papers and got really annoyed by some people in a particular article. It just seem as though people in Singapore are extremely intolerant to others&#8217; views and/or opinions. It just reminds me of primary school days where &#8220;kuai kias&#8221; (Good Boys/Girls) go around complaining to teachers about every little &#8220;bad&#8221; thing that somebody said so as to see him/her punished. Seriously, MYOB, Mind Your Own Business or Master Your Own Big-Bad-Mouth.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Unbelievable. Singaporeans are really amazing. No wonder for the need for ridiculously tight media censorship. &#8220;Singaporeans can&#8217;t think for themselves&#8221;, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/lists.jammed.com/IWAR/1998/03/0001.html']);"  href="http://lists.jammed.com/IWAR/1998/03/0001.html">Singapore Censorship</a> and a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.isoc.org/HMP/PAPER/132/txt/paper.txt']);"  href="http://www.isoc.org/HMP/PAPER/132/txt/paper.txt">paper</a> on it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So much for a gracious society.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now for blogs, I&#8217;m still shocked by the gross misconception by the general &#8220;misinformed&#8221; (thanks ST) public. As such, those who <em>think</em> they know what blogs are, think that blogs are generally negative (thanks ST). There have been a few arguments against blogs that I&#8217;ve heard, and I feel the itch to rebutt them now, here.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>But first, a stupid disclaimer. All content contained herein are based solely on my (mis)informed opinion and in no way affliated to any organisations or what nots that I belong to or represent. Furthermore, examples given are purely fictional and any resemblences to real life events are purely coincidental.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>They say that &#8220;it&#8217;s easy to make friends via blogs and most of them are bad&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, isn&#8217;t life about meeting people and knowing what&#8217;s right from wrong? &#21021;&#29983;&#20043;&#29322;&#19981;&#24597;&#34382; (new born calfs don&#8217;t fear tigers). So, if you don&#8217;t learn/see what&#8217;s bad, how would you know if something&#8217;s bad when you see it? Yes yes... It&#8217;s like playing with fire, but oh well.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>They say that &#8220;airing one&#8217;s views would result in abuse of free speech&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, what&#8217;s free speech? How can you abuse something which is free, as in liberal?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>They say that &#8220;blogging itself is a waste of time&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Hmm... If it improves your writing skills and formal language use, why not? I don&#8217;t believe speech can replace writing practice. If so, I would be getting high marks with ease, so would anyone else.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>How amusing... Got anymore anti-blogging comments? Feel free to air it out, I won&#8217;t call the police to use the Sedition Act on you. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Without much change in my interests, my subject combination for A levels should be as follows:-</p>
</p><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Subject</th></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Physics</td></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Mathematics</td></tr><tr><td>H1</td><td>Chemistry</td></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Computer Science <i>or</i> Economics</td></tr><tr><td>H2</td><td>Knowledge and Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>H1</td><td>Project Work</td></tr></table><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I guess with this simple subject combination, I&#8217;ll keep my grades up, life easy and choices open for the long run as I&#8217;ve yet to decide on the course to take in University.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Darned... My iPod Mini&#8217;s full. Gotta clear out some old songs and put the new ones in. The next iPod that I&#8217;m going to get must have a capacity of greater than 10GB.</p></p>
