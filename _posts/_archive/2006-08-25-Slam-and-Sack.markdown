<p class="whiteline"><p>Two <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/mymaturerantings.blogspot.com/']);"  href="http://mymaturerantings.blogspot.com/">writing</a> <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/whitestreek.blogspot.com/']);"  href="http://whitestreek.blogspot.com/">repositories</a> were brought to my attention. I think they are good reads, the latter especially.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m wondering again; what would happen to an educational officer if he or she physically manhandles a student? <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.corpun.com/sgs00405.htm']);"  href="http://www.corpun.com/sgs00405.htm">This principal</a> resigned voluntarily. Not sure if there are others but hearing it, the punishment looks severe.</p>

Looking back, I&#8217;ve got no idea of what I&#8217;d done; it looked as if I&#8217;ve most productively wasted 8 months of my life, but I guess the results appear much later.</p>
