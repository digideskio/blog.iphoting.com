<p class="whiteline"><p>Christmas, Christ&#8217;s Mass, is known this year by its original reason for existance more than before. Wonderful. So many responded to the altar call; so many were saved.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>In short, Merry and Blessed Christmas to all you readers out there; Happy holidays if you do not celebrate Christmas (I wonder if you go shopping buying presents).</p></p>
