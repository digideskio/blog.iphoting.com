<p class="whiteline"><p>Today is an interesting start.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Chapel is a relief and I hope it&#8217;s not the pinnacle - the Best is Yet to Be.<!-- The sermon reminded me of how I got myself rededicated many years ago. Long story short, long ago I'd backslid far far away and was slowly called back to Him. So, I decided to ask God one day, "Let someone invite me to a Church and for whichever does it first, may it be the one that I shall plant myself in, and I shall rededicate myself to you; Amen". Well, within a few months (or less; can't recall timeframes - photographic memories don't come with date stamps on the images), a knock came and the rest is history. On retrospect, it was rather amusing given the circumstances.--></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then today more funny. A teacher told us to just aim for a pass for the promos as the rational is that passing for scoring full marks would result in promotion; no difference. I&#8217;ll have to admit that that&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard such a thing from a teacher. Then, the teacher also told us that there are many teachers who refuse to embrace change and hence, topics removed from syllabus might still appear in the examinations. Hence, the best way out is to know everything.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Recess had been fruitful. I managed to engineer a timetable. Now, to follow it.</p></p>
