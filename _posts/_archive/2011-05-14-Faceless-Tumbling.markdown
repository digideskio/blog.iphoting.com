<p class="whiteline"><p>When I first started mini-blogging on my <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/tumblr.iphoting.com/']);"  href="http://tumblr.iphoting.com/">Tumblr</a>, I thought that I no longer had much to write on this blog anymore. After all, all thought and observations can be posted on Tumblr right?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I was wrong. Tumblr is, in many ways, handicapped. It promotes a viral distribution of content among the community but it does not encourage a 2-way discussion and interaction with content owners. A quick stroll down the Tumblr lane exposes Tumblrs that consists of nothing but &#8220;reblogged&#8221; posts from other Tumblrs. There is little curation. Even less are opinions being formed. Too many people are parroting information, but to who and for what?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;ve decided that opinion pieces are best blogged while linked-list items are best left on Tumblr as it allows the title of the post to be set to the linked site. Hence, I shall migrate a few opinion pieces from Tumblr to this place to get the ball rolling in reigniting this blog.</p></p>
