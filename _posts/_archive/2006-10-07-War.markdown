<p class="whiteline"><p>An examination is just like war. Theories from <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu">Sun Tzu</a>&#8217;s <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">Art of War</a> can be applied here to a certain extent.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Let me cite a simple example to demonstrate the application of an aspect of his theories.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>知己知彼, 百戰百勝, or better known in English, &#8220;if you know both yourself and your enemy, you will come out of one hundred battles with one hundred victories&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Enemy refers to the questions that appears in the examination papers, and the best way to know them is by studying the TYS. The ways of the enemy would be the questions and the ways to attack the enemy successfully would be the TYS answer key. The numerous battles would refer to the countless numbers of questions done correctly. Knowing yourself, most importantly, would be to know your past mistakes and never to commit them again.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>All these assuming that your conceptual knowledge is available, which can be obtained by understanding and knowing the subject.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, there&#8217;s another important aspect to war, which is to visualise how it is to be fought. Winning it in your mind is a battle half won.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Refer to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.chinapage.com/sunzi-e.html']);"  href="http://www.chinapage.com/sunzi-e.html">this site</a> for further reading of the work.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With that in hand, you can&#8217;t fail an examination paper unless something freakish happen, like the paper given in the wrong language, or you suddenly collapse on the table due to the haze which has affected your breathing severely.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In short, the success in examinations is largely based on this breakdown, id est, 50% psychology (I know I can shit), 10% memory work (what&#8217;s shit), 10% conceptual knowledge (how to shit), 10% intelligent nonsense generation (bull shit), 10% derivation skills (for forgotten shit), and most importantly 10% intelligence (for unexpected shit).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, don&#8217;t forget, the setters of the examination papers (masterminds) are humans too and would have pre-empted our movements! Ever wondered why the Chemisery, oops, I mean, Chemistry, FYS doesn&#8217;t come with any answer keys? Or that our notes are noticeably briefer, or to put it bluntly, useless, compared to our JC counterparts? Pre-emptive strike I tell you! <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Woo hoo, PSI at 143! Come on, come on, a little more to 200, go go go!</p></p>
