<p class="whiteline"><p>Taxes have always been unpopular but necessary to fund the government. It also has an effect in limiting the money supply, similar to the effect of increasing interest rates.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Inflation on the other hand has always been the pain in every financial planner&#8217;s neck. It&#8217;s easy to bring it up and extremely damaging to control and reduce it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve been wondering lately about the recent spate of price increases and the seemingly unrelated inflationary pressures.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Given the dichotomy of the credit freeze and the spiralling increase of prices, based on money supply theory, both effects should cancel each other out. However, I&#8217;m guessing that as this effect is not in equilibrium and hence further money supply manipulation is required.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As mentioned, one of the effects of taxes is to reduce the amount of money flowing in the economy. Though possibly effective in annulling the cash injections by the central bank, it is highly unpopular and enacting it is not an option in technical recessions. The GST trump card however can&#8217;t be used again as it has been played this year. The next possible avenue to do so would be in the pricing of commodity items which everyone needs, desperately. Something that just functions like a tax but with another name.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And so, conveniently blaming the market, we see a 21% hike in tariffs with little reason.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Do I make any sense? What do you think?</p></p>
