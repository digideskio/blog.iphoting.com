<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8217;The System&#8217; seems to have a liking for our organisation. Makes me wonder.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My skill in controlling and managing sleep has improved. From my past experiences, we (you might be the exception) sleep in 1.5 hours blocks. Waking up or be forced to wake up while a cycle is in progress would lead to great mental difficulties in waking up. On the other hand, waking up just in-between cycles would make it much easier. However, although it&#8217;ll be easier to arise from bed, this doesn&#8217;t mean that less sleep is required. Though you can save time from sleeping, your physical body might still be more reluctant than your mind to arise from bed. As such, I&#8217;ve planned to sleep from 10 pm to 4 am and wake to study. This way, doing productive study when awake results in better yields. After all, one doesn&#8217;t learn or do much during the 9 hours in school. Though non-productive, it&#8217;s highly physically draining.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, a miracle. Despite leaving my house 5 minutes later than usual (as my father left home without his phone, requiring a turn-back), experiencing massive traffic jams due to <em>two</em> concurrent accidents around the same area along CTE (accidents on the left and right, before and within the tunnel), together with the usual Dover Road routine, I arrived in school <em>in time</em> for assembly. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Divine intervention and skilful driving. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> It certainly was close; I hate being late regardless of how valid the reason might be.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This reminds me. Imagine a beautiful car travelling with decent speed, faster than and looking better than many others, but with a corroding engine. What would happen? Worst, it leaks fuel at a rather high rate.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh well, I find it highly amusing that we&#8217;re told not to compare with JCs nor request for policies from JCs to be adopted. YET, we have promos which take up so much of our time, affecting us so much, but eventually useless. What&#8217;s more, file checks (with notes inside it) right before the exams isn&#8217;t the smartest thing to do. After all, the main use for notes (to me) are to be for revision before the examinations.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>It&#8217;s almost showtime.</p></p>
