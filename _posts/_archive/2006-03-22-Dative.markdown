<p class="whiteline"><p>Chemistry lessons have been the most interesting so far. I like the way the lessons are conducted - I got to put in 90% concentration in order to follow and comprehend information being dished out at little yet provoking amounts. This certainly bugs my curiosity such that I will go find out more about such &#8216;theoretical&#8217; concepts, meanwhile invalidating a dozen or more theories that I was taught to know. So far, I&#8217;m glad that every question that I&#8217;ve asked has an answer, though it need not be answerable in a few breaths.</p>

Although I don&#8217;t really fancy drinking coffee in times of no-need, I decided to satisfy my liking for latte and try it out. To my horror, the coffee smells and tastes in a standard that&#8217;s less than desirable.</p>
