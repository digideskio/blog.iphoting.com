<p class="whiteline"><p>Gosh, I&#8217;m falling sick, all the signs are pointing to it â€“ ulcer in mouth, bitter saliva, heatiness, sore in neck, tiredness, weakening pulse, etc. I&#8217;ve done all that I can do, i.e. herbal tea, sleeping early, drinking and eating properly, etc, but my health is still going downwards. I am going to have to call in sick and stay away from school tomorrow before my health gets worst requiring an even longer recovery period.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, (Rev. Dr.) Joyce Meyer talked about something very simple but extremely weighted. The gist of it was about love but it was more than just that. Rev 16:15 says, &#8220;Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and <em>keeps his garments</em>, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What clothes?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Col 3:12, 14 (NLT) reads, &#8220;Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must <em>clothe</em> yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience...Above all, clothe yourselves with <em>love</em>, which binds us all together in perfect harmony.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Yes, spiritual clothes, that God sees.</p></p>
