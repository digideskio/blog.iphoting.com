<p class="whiteline"><p>Back from COMPSERV | CST camp. I&#8217;m glad that everything managed to proceed as according to schedule despite the various odds that cropped up. &#8220;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,&#8221; and that&#8217;s what kept things together and going.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>When multiple positive coincidences happen one after another with prayer, it&#8217;s no longer just <em>coincidence</em>. At the very least, it&#8217;s divine intervention; but usually, it&#8217;s a miracle.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>It&#8217;s almost Christmas; I&#8217;ve got shopping and card generation things to be done.</p></p>
