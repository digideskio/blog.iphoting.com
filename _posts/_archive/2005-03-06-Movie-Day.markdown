<p class="whiteline"><p>Went to SimLim Square and got a new Viewsonic 15" LCD Monitor for like $290. Not that it&#8217;s the best, but well, it&#8217;s cheap.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, I also bought a new Kingston 512mb thumbdrive for $50 as my 64mb one is overflowing. Followed by a box of diskettes, diskette drive and, almost a tube of DVD-Rs.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Off to PS soon after to buy movie tix. 4.40pm Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle. Before that, ate, then went to play some LAN and some Daytona + Initial D.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The movie overall was good. I give it 4 upon 5.</p></p>
