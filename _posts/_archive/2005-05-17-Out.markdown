<p class="whiteline"><p>Went to &#8216;visit&#8217; the CDB today. Breezed through Nee Ann City, Plaza Singapura, Paragon and Wheelock Place.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Watch Coach Carter at PS... It&#8217;s an ok movie <i>lah</i>. I give it a rating of 3.5/5.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, planned to watch Kingdom of Heaven, but didn&#8217;t due to under-aged people tagging along.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Subsequent events that I&#8217;ve observed was appalling.... Don&#8217;t wanna comment here.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Ate at Soul Garden, where more than 50% of the group don&#8217;t know how to cook. Some of them didn&#8217;t even know that a pair pf chopsticks that touch raw meat should not be used for cooked food. Sad.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Read &#8220;The Hitchiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; at Borders and went home to sleep.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Not a nice day... Irky events.</p></p>
