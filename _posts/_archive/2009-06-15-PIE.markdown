<p class="whiteline"><p>To be really frank, I still have some degree of fears when attempting to drive on my own. I&#8217;m just not used to driving alone, without someone beside me, acting as the &#8216;last-resort&#8217; lookout for traffic which I may have inadvertently missed.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With my limited driving hours and experience, I find that the PIE is the hardest expressway to handle as it is very bendy and filled with much traffic in the mornings. Driving along this expressway from end to end during rush hours is quite a challenge as the traffic is extremely heavy, flooded with heavy trucks and lorries from lanes 2 to 4, near Pioneer area. Squeezing in between them and changing lanes is a sure way to increase ones speed/distance judgment.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Fortunately, in a week and two days time, my course in the Far West would end and I&#8217;ll be back to work at the Far North. By the time I check my work mail, it would have been 5 weeks since I&#8217;d last touched it. I&#8217;m guessing that my mailbox would have been full by now. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
