<p class="whiteline"><p>Today marks the end of my official tenure in Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) as a student. As such, I would relinquish all official positions that I&#8217;m currently holding, indefinitely or until I return to the school officially, with effect from tomorrow.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To all those who have worked/endured with me in one way or the other, a big <b>Thank You</b> goes out to you for your support <i>and</i> tolerance! My well-wishes and love goes with you; may all your future endeavors be fruitful and that safety and wisdom remains with you.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My email address, myself [at] iphoting [dot] com, would remain for as long as I can afford to keep it and at anytime you need any advice or help, feel free to email me. Although I am no longer an official student of the school, do keep me informed on the happenings of the school as I&#8217;m somewhat attached to this alma mater of mine, especially COMPSERV.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My four &#8220;long&#8221; years in this school has finally come to a conclusion, pending the O-Levels. It&#8217;s certainly an experience that I&#8217;ll take with me, even to the end of my days. The lessons on red tape and politics, apple polishing and back-stabbing, never would I have learnt these in any ordinary school. The wonderful teachers which I&#8217;ve encountered and met, some have changed my life, others have opened my eyes to the greater world.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The very teacher, among others that I must mention, is Mrs Sharon Woon. She&#8217;s the most inspiring teacher that I&#8217;ve encountered (actually, all are) and left a deep mark within my memory. I believe that my encounter with her was largely fate; it brought me in and out of OM (Odyssey of the Mind), and be a &#8220;not so good&#8221; (A1 nevertheless) lower secondary art student.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, another teacher who gave me many insights to the &#8220;way of the world&#8221; was Ms. Phuan. Throughout my career within the computer club, I&#8217;ve learnt the flip side of things - The very things that I believe all future office-workers-to-be should know and that schools should all have lessons on them... how ironic.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Apart from teachers, my seniors also deserve notable mention. One of them is Benedict Chan. He&#8217;d taught me something which I&#8217;ll never forget - time is made, not given. His can-do, regardless (after thought) attitude showed me that when there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s always a way with sufficient brain power.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There are many many more people that I&#8217;ll love to devote a paragraph to but I guess that&#8217;ll make a novel/auto-biography. So, if you&#8217;re not mentioned but have been a part of my life somehow, rest assured, you&#8217;re acknowledged. The least you could do would be to add me on friendster so that I&#8217;ll not leave you out (accidentally) when I were to pen a biography. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh well, a new chapter of my life would begin shortly. My optimism seems remarkably stronger than before.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Farewells are inevitable, but we will meet again.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Spent the last few days of school, perfecting my skills in the intellectual game of bridge, where no form of gambling was involved. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
