<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;The greatest healing therapy is fellowship&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>How interesting.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>While studying <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation">motivation</a> in my B &amp; M classes, I have come to a conclusion that people are all very unique and interesting. No generalising can work across the board for everyone. One-size fits all never works with people, not even socks.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In the notes I&#8217;ve received, there are at least three general theories about factors that influence people (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow</a>, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_theory']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_theory">Herzberg</a>, &amp; <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_theory_Y']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_theory_Y">McGregor</a>), one on psychological influences that may affect motivation (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McClelland']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McClelland">McClelland</a>), and another on the process of motivation itself (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectancy_theory']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectancy_theory">Vroom</a>). Amusingly, each one of them is not sufficiently comprehensive nor completely compatible with each other. A selective synergy is required to produce one that is tailor made for the particular situation or group of people.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>That, mastering the art of relating to and with people, is the key to this world, success and all.</p></p>
