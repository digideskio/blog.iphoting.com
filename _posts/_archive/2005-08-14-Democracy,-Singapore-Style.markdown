<p class="whiteline"><p>I remember the pledge, which I think it&#8217;s more or less outdated.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">We, the citizens of Singapore,</p><p class="break">pledge ourselves as one united people,</p><p class="break">regardless of race, language or religion,</p><p class="break">to build a democratic society</p><p class="break">based on justice and equality</p><p class="break">so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and</p><p class="break">progress for our nation.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now that you&#8217;ve read the <i>vision</i> of Singapore, I shall state some interesting developments in <i>reality</i>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Straits Times, 14th August, 2005:-</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">PRESIDENT S R Nathan looks set to stay for another six years in office, after a committee yesterday decared him as the only eligible candidate.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If you think you&#8217;ve seen the word <em>committee</em>, you aren&#8217;t wrong. You might also wonder, why is a committee in-charge of choosing candidates instead of letting the public select suitable candidates themselves based on their intelligence? Think Animal Farm. The three member committee is always right as no appeals are allowed.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Does it mean that Singaporeans aren&#8217;t capable of even knowing who&#8217;s suitable for the job?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Just a recap, the definition of democracy is:-</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">de·moc·ra·cy (d-mkr-s)</p><p class="whiteline">n. pl. de·moc·ra·cies
</p><p class="break">   1. Government by the people, exercised either directly or through elected representatives.</p><p class="break">   2. A political or social unit that has such a government.</p><p class="break">   3. The common people, considered as the primary source of political power.</p><p class="break">   4. Majority rule.</p><p class="break">   5. The principles of social equality and respect for the individual within a community.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Look at the 5 points, which of them has been exercised in Singapore? The answer is left as an exercise for the reader. No prizes for getting the correct answer though.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Lately, there&#8217;s also been a &#8220;riot&#8221; in Singapore, where approxmately 40 police officers came to &#8220;maintain peace&#8221;. At last count, the number of &#8220;rioters&#8221; was 4 (four). Yes, four. For more information, don&#8217;t bother looking in the state-controlled media, it&#8217;s too embarrassing to be shown. Look <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D939D1FD-3FC9-4644-8A28-A8E4F835AAF9.htm']);"  href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D939D1FD-3FC9-4644-8A28-A8E4F835AAF9.htm">here </a> and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlenkfprotest1.html']);"  href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlenkfprotest1.html">here</a> instead. For those who&#8217;re curious, they were dispersed with &#8220;public nuisance&#8221;. Upon further questioning the officer on the offence, he replied with “The offence is public nuisance under the Miscellaneous Offences Act. It is a seizable offence, which means you may be arrested.” Make your own conclusions.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m utterly disgusted by the actions. It makes me, a Singaporean, much less to want to remain one. Imagine people all over the world reading this article, what would they think? How would they see us? People who can&#8217;t think on their own? A government which does all sorts of ungracious things?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>From the SDP site:-</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="whiteline">Several questions need to be asked from this episode :
</p><p class="whiteline">One, did the police have the right to order the protesters to leave especially when there were only four of them? The law clearly states that only five or more people gathered in a public place constitutes an illegal assembly.
</p><p class="whiteline">Two, did the police see the protesters creating a commotion and making a nuisance of themselves? Throughout the protest all four protesters stood silently until the police started questioning them.
</p><p class="break">Three, why is the Singapore Government so afraid of four peaceful protesters that it had to send in the riot squad? Signs of insecurity perhaps?</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I really wonder.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The GEs are coming soon and it&#8217;ll be no surprises that it&#8217;ll be &#8220;not-fair-enough&#8221; according to the majority of my friends. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, read <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymander']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymander">this</a>.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>So, whatever the case is, please vote in the GE <em>responsibly</em>; vote for the party which delievers its <em>promises</em> and is <em>upright</em>.</p></p>
