<p class="whiteline"><p>To those suffering under the generic education system, I offer you my heartfelt condolences over the demense of your June Holidays.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It has been a blink of an eye since the commence of the long awaited one month-long &#8220;rest&#8221; or &#8220;study&#8221; period, also known as the June Holidays.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As I look back once again to take stock, I see nothing significant that can give me 7 points in the two exams which are coming up really soon.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To date, I have only lightly read through the textbooks of the major <em>logical</em> subjects, and completed my pile of holiday homework (Yeah! For the first time, in time). What are the odds of achieving my aims?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I remember that when I was in Primary 6, I saw myself aiming for 240 points in the PSLE. Seriously, I don&#8217;t recall myself studying (hard). Thus, I got 235 for my prelims and subsequently 257 for the PSLE. Not that the few weeks between the prelims and the PSLE made much of a difference; it&#8217;s just the difficulty that wasn&#8217;t constant.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, I wonder again. Would it be so again this time? I guess not. As this is a major exam, much bigger and important that the PSLE, I have decided that going purely by intelligence and not hardwork is not the way to go.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Therefore, to ensure that I don&#8217;t screw myself at this stage of my life (as if I&#8217;m not already screwed), I hereby declare that I will aim for and achieve 8 points for my prelims and 7 points for my O-Levels.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Failing which, I would have to endure admission into a school that isn&#8217;t my first choice.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Should I succeed, I <em>would</em> be able to get myself in VJC (I pray and hope) and earn myself a lappy which my parents would pay for.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thus, in my endeavor to achieve such aims and aspirations, I have decided to reduce distractions and to become a &#8220;<em>good</em>&#8221; student. That is, to complete my homework <em>in</em> time as opposed to <em>on</em> time; to ensure that I <em>fully_understand</em> everything that had been taught and expressed on worksheets, past year papers, etc.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To ensure that:-</p>
</p><ul>
<li>
I don&#8217;t waste my time offering Higher Chinese, I have decided to commit one chapter to memory per two days.</li>
<li>
<em>All</em> my <em>three</em> sciences get an A1, I would make certain that the subjects&#8217; TYS be completed in full, at least once through, pior to the prelims.</li>
<li>
<em>Both</em> my A and E Maths get an A1, I have to make sure that I&#8217;m able to solve any question pertaining to the syllabus, regardless of source.</li>
<li>
I achieve an A1 for Geography (Core), I will have to know a large portion of the Geography textbook by heart.</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With 6 subjects at A1 and HCL better than or equal to C6, I think my L1R5 target would be possible to achieve.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Last but not least, I would continue blogging in an attempt to inch my English standard as high as possible.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Therefore, in theory, if all goes well, my L1R5 would be 2 + 5 = 7. 2 as my confidence of achieving an A1 for English is low, given my terrible standard of English.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With that, I wish you, all readers out there, a happy last day of June Holidays.</p></p>
