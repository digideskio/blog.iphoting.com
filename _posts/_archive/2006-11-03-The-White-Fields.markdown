<p class="whiteline"><p>The pieces are falling into place; the giant chessboard is geared towards the final checkmate; the pieces are getting their best angle-of-attack towards the final victory. First, there came relevance to the harvest fields (buying the tools of harvest), then penetration (moving out with the tools into the heart of the fields), and then now, the great harvest of the white fields.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest....I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p></blockquote><p>

</p><blockquote><p class="whiteline">“O Sovereign Lord,” I said, “I can’t speak for you! I’m too young!”
</p><p class="whiteline">The Lord replied, “Don’t say, ‘I’m too young,’ for you must go wherever I send you and say whatever I tell you. And don’t be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect you. I, the Lord, have spoken!” Then the Lord reached out and touched my mouth and said,
</p><p class="break">“Look, I have put my words in your mouth!</p><p class="break">Today I appoint you to stand up</p><p class="break">against nations and kingdoms.</p><p class="break">Some you must uproot and tear down,</p><p class="break">destroy and overthrow.</p><p class="break">Others you must build up</p><p class="break">and plant.”</p></blockquote><p>
