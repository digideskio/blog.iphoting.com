<p class="whiteline"><p>Hmm... A <i>Gold</i> Award for contributions to my UYO... Let me think, what have I done? And then, there&#8217;s a guy telling me that my name was mentioned during the SoH interview. I think it&#8217;s more than hilarious as I&#8217;m not supposed to have anything to do with it. In fact, my teacher didn&#8217;t even put my name down for nominations, <i>I think</i>. Or at least, I wasn&#8217;t told.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, I&#8217;d rather this a prank than some intent backstabbing as I&#8217;m almost used to them. Sometimes, more creativity is required get me.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, I was told that for CCAs points, CCA points from more than one CCA can be counted together. So, after some mental calculations, I think my points have reached a number where my fingers, and maybe toes, could no longer keep track of them. A1 requires only about 9 points; I&#8217;ve got about that with my UYO alone. With my second CCA (thanks to school policy), it&#8217;ll be more than 9. Notwithstanding that, I still have class committee positions and national competitions that I&#8217;ve represented the school before. Therefore, I&#8217;ve got reason to believe that I&#8217;ve got too many CCA points, assuming that the teachers key all that I deserve into the system, which I <i>doubt</i>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With the new A-Level curriculum beginning 2006, the flexiblity offered on paper is impressive. Whether it really achieves such said objectives is another thing. It&#8217;s more flexible than the IB system, with half or a quater of the price. In fact, I&#8217;m starting to be grateful that I wasn&#8217;t admitted into the IB programme. Afterall, O-Levels are meant to be seen as easy anyway, on hindsight.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Went for my friend&#8217;s house warming yesterday. Was amused by the people I&#8217;d met there. What really surprised me that there are people there, in my friend&#8217;s house, that my friend didn&#8217;t know. Anyway, I spent my time there, instead of going for Chinese tuition, playing GTA: SA. Violent and addictive.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Lately, I&#8217;ve encountered a large number of people with temporary mental blocks.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, I find Enya&#8217;s songs nice and learnt how to play A Day Without Rain on the piano (I&#8217;ve retired from the piano 3 years ago by the way). I didn&#8217;t plan to memorize the score anyway, so don&#8217;t bother asking me to perform. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/tongue.png" alt=":-P" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A few days ago, I remember that I got 30/40 for my mock Aural-Oral exam with my teacher. Given my poor language capabilities and that reading is a rare thing for me to do, I was quite surprised that I&#8217;d got such marks. What made me laughed most was that I was &#8220;<em>praised</em>&#8221; for not running-out-of-things-to-say during the &#8220;Picture Discussion&#8221; section. WTF. It&#8217;s a picture, what&#8217;s so hard with talking about what you see?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Talking about something that you&#8217;ve not seen nor had any experience with during the &#8220;conversation&#8221; section is slightly more interesting. At least, it made my brain move. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/tongue.png" alt=":-P" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> An exercise on BS and sounding convincing. Body language and tone plays a big part too. I think the most effective technique I&#8217;ve used so far was laughter.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I don&#8217;t know, I somehow have the skill to make people laugh if I know them. Someone also told me that my words (verbal) tend to have multiple meanings. On retrospect, I think they do, however, at that point of time, I wasn&#8217;t even consciously aware of my ability to do so.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Reading through my previous posts seem so amusing. There&#8217;s just so many double (and treble) meanings that I&#8217;ve unwittingly placed in there. So, whenever you quote me, remember to check if there&#8217;s a meaning between those lines although superficial checks will usually result in an empty space. At least, not verbatim, but with attribution.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As for the London Blasts, my deepest condolences to those affected in anyway.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With that, my eyes scream for me to rest, so as to enjoy the new day that God has already made.</p></p>
