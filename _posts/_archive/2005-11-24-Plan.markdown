<p class="whiteline"><p>After further scrutiny of my form a, I realised that I&#8217;m qualified for the (Provisional) Edusave Scholarship (for IP Schools in Independent IP Schools/JC).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Which means, ACS(I) IBDP <i>might</i> just be my first choice.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, there is still a day or two more to pray about it, and I&#8217;ll do so.</p>
