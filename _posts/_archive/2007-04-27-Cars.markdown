<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, we went to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA">IKEA</a> for lunch after school. Chatted and chatted until it was like 4.30 pm and decided to make our way home.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, while walking towards Queenstown MRT station, we saw the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> showroom and decided to give it a visit. After all, we are poor and have nothing to lose, no sales people would be mad enough to hard sell cars to 18 year olds who don&#8217;t even have jobs. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> That&#8217;s when the amusement starts, and we were to soon discover something first hand.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Apart from the Mercedes-Benz showroom, we also went to BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Renault, Subaru, Toyota, Lexus, and walked past Jaguar, Peugeot, Hyundai, Volvo, and Mini.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>All the showroom with unoccupied sales personnel exhibited this amusing behaviour. Conventionally, students dressed in uniform entering a car showroom would probably be ignored by most sales people. After all, it&#8217;s a waste of breath talking to people who won&#8217;t and can&#8217;t buy your product.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Apparently, when we walked passed the reception counters and when our school badges became more prominently recognisable, sales people kick into action and bother to pose the standard question, &#8220;Hi, how may I help you?&#8221; or &#8220;Would you need any assistance?&#8221;. The best was, &#8220;If you&#8217;re just looking around, I&#8217;ll be right here if you need any help.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>From this, I&#8217;ve learnt that the school badge and name holds more value than all three of our net worth combined. It&#8217;s so high that even Mercedes-Benz sales people bothered to talk to us students.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The service we got was the following, in order of quality:-</p>
</p><ol><li>Renault</li><li>Mercedes-Benz</li><li><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru">Subaru</a></li></ol><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Others listed have sales people either too busy or can&#8217;t be bothered. Special mention goes to Toyota and Lexus which have null service.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, I guess in the future when I were to buy a Mercedes-Benz, I&#8217;ll enter the showroom dressed normally, not looking expensive in any way. The sales person who bothers would be lucky. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>All in all, this was a fascinating and interesting experience and experiment.</p></p>
