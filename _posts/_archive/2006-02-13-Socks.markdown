<p class="whiteline"><p>I like my almost all of my subject teachers, one of them (this time) rocks! in the way I like <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">&#8220;Hand in your files next monday. Please cooperate here - I don&#8217;t believe in asking post-secondary students to hand in their files for checking, but I don&#8217;t have the energy and time to argue with management about this.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Wonderful. From the above snippet, I can tell that the secondary school houses pre-university students and has an organisational relationship similar to SMBs (with similar red-tape lengths).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, lately there&#8217;s always an argument on why this school doesn&#8217;t have holidays for students as opposed to JCs where there are 1 to 2 days of break. A simple and truthful answer would be that it&#8217;s a secondary school and it has no need to follow the JC modus operandi.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Why should school start 10 minutes earlier when it had been fine all along and that there had been a negative feasibility report done? A simple sweeping answer is that everyone can wake up earlier and come to school earlier. The severe traffic condition from 6.50am to 7.40am was not addressed. If you cannot imagine how it&#8217;s like, think of the traffic condition at the causeway during peak hours, swapping motocycles for cars, along a 2 lane road with 3 sets of traffic lights - and everyone is in a rush.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Pseudo-feedback turning into a justification session; we need debaters.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And the todo list on my Palm is 3 pages long, with the furthest due date a week from now.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another thing which amused me greatly is this. The sound and video from the auditorium is connected via two cables to the CPA, passing through the now-turned-walkway area. Today, I was told that the contractors snipped those cables last weekend while building the walkway and as such, direct live sound and video feeds are no longer available. Fortunately, mpac already has got it&#8217;s live web/telecast system working via the school lan/internet, and it will thus become indispensable henceforth, paving way for more cash to fund this project soon.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Now, I&#8217;m back to the 3 English (Lit) essays due this week.</p></p>
