<p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s after so much time that my sub-consciousness has finally come up with a response, albeit non-comprehensive, to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>&#8217; <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion">The God Delusion</a>, though I have yet to finish reading the whole book (it gets boring as his arguments are all similar, but with a different perspective). Furthermore, writing a comprehensive counter argument is a complete waste of time. It&#8217;s like the (uncalled for) response to Da Vinci Code movie by the church, simply unnecessary.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For those of you who have yet to read the book, I&#8217;ll list 4 main points (courtesy of Wikipedia):-</p>
</p><ul><li>Atheists can be happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.</li><li>Natural selection and other scientific theories are superior to a &#8220;God hypothesis&#8221; in explaining the living world and perhaps even the cosmos</li><li>Children should not be labelled by their parents&#8217; religion. Terms like &#8220;Catholic child&#8221; or &#8220;Muslim child&#8221; should make people flinch.</li><li>Atheists should be proud, not apologetic, because atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind.</li></ul><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ll specifically target the second point in this case.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Some general comments about this author first. From this writing, I can see that this guy is a major proponent that &#8220;Science is <em>the</em> Truth to all&#8221;. If you have attended the famous and (almost) world renown <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">RDF</a> demonstration lecture by none other than <em>the</em> chess master, you would have some how find or learn or be proven that Science is not <em>all</em>, easily seen in <em>Selective Subjectivism</em> written in Sir Arthur Eddington&#8217;s <em>Philosophy of Physical Science</em>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As my skills in explaining myself are pretty weak as you can see, I shall use a simple but common analogy to drive my point across. Interpretation is allowed on various levels.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_matrix']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_matrix">The Matrix</a> (first movie only). If you have not watched the first movie, go and do so before reading on or you&#8217;ll be lost.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Let&#8217;s set some postulates. Think of it this way, the idea that the <em>Matrix</em> exists is similar to the idea that God exists. Within the Matrix, it is impossible to prove that the matrix <em>is</em> or otherwise. Same applies to God who created this world, as opposed to evolution, exists or otherwise.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Do you choose to believe? The red or the blue pill? To know the Truth or to continue enjoying everything, which tastes like chicken? If you don&#8217;t believe, you&#8217;ll just wake up like any other normal day from your bed, as if nothing has happened. If you do believe, you would wake up and see, for &#8220;the Truth shall set you free&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Haha, this somewhat neutralises a large part of the book. Just read the book with this matrix analogy in mind and you can see how it unfolds.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then you might just be wondering, how on earth do I get &#8216;unplugged&#8217; from the matrix? Oh, that&#8217;s easy but it will require a certain degree of spiritual maturity. Simply, deja vu is a prime &#8216;common grace&#8217; example. Look me up if you want a more comprehensive elaboration on this aspect. Words are more than required for this or it&#8217;ll be way too confusing.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That&#8217;s about all that I want to write about. There are further correlations but I&#8217;ll not touch on them at this stage. Comment and help me see this idea from more perspectives, by poking holes at appropriate places, or otherwise. Thanks. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Haha, praise God. The solution to my ToK essay has been sitting in this book (ironically), next to my bed all along, just as I&#8217;d asked for help. I should have had more discipline to read the book with greater priority and I&#8217;d have less frustration with this simple essay.</p></p>
