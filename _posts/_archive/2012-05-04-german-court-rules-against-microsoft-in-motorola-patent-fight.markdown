[Reuters][source]:

> A court in Mannheim ruled on Wednesday that Microsoft infringed Motorola Mobility's patents and ordered Microsoft to remove its popular Xbox 360 gaming consoles and Windows 7 operating system software from the German market.

> However, Microsoft said that the ruling did not mean that its products would be taken off retailers' shelves because a U.S. district court in Seattle has granted Microsoft a preliminary injunction against Motorola to prevent the phone maker from enforcing any German court order.

I cannot even begin to describe this lunacy that is going on with IP law and enforcement.

This needs to stop before the true repercussions on innovation in everyday life is felt. Look no furtherâ€”the drug industry.
