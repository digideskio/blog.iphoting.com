<p class="whiteline"><p>Throughout my course of study, I&#8217;ve yet to learn the formula or details about inertia, Newton&#8217;s first law. The only thing I know about it is its definition.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">When no force acts on an object (or when the forces acting on it cancel), it moves in a straight line at constant speed.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Or</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">The tendency of a body to maintain its state of uniform motion unless acted on by an external unbalanced force.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whichever is the accurate latin equivlent.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This applies to a group of (un)motivated people too. From observation, it takes <i>a lot</i> (I&#8217;ve yet to find a way to quantify the amount) of &#8220;force&#8221; to attempt to &#8220;move&#8221; them to a place or to do something.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The method to quantify the amount of &#8220;force&#8221; used is made even harder when one has to account for, apart from many others, the impact of &#8220;authority&#8221;, tone and social pressure of the &#8220;force&#8221;. One thing that I&#8217;ve noticed that the greater the number of times the particular &#8220;force&#8221; is used, possibily repeatedly, the higher the tendency for it to be disregarded.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, another interesting thing would be to equate the &#8220;forces&#8221; or push-factors versus the &#8220;tendency to maintain the uniform state of motion&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Bah. I&#8217;ll use my December holidays to figure this out, not my &#8220;studying&#8221; time.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Darn. Didn&#8217;t get to watch Peter Pan musical.</p></p>
