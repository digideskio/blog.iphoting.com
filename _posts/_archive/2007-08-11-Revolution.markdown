<p class="whiteline"><p>I always have a bunch of visuals stuck up in my head because I have yet to find a way to properly express it graphically. These graphics came from dreams I have had sometime ago but they happen to cling onto my memory for a rather extended period of time. One of these days, I got to just root myself to a chair and start sketching. All those A1s for art will certainly be wasted if I haven&#8217;t done anything related to it for the past 4 years.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Generally, I need to get these three images off my mind. The first consist of a huge red moon which seems to be moving nearer toward Earth with a clear black sky in the background, view from a HDB flat window in very low lighting conditions. The second is a picture of a flaming sky with tiny fist-sized rocks burning with fire, falling in rapid succession onto the ground. In the middle-ground right lies a &#8220;city-hall&#8221; building diagonally with black burnt marks all over, with people running and walking all over with urgency, yet aimlessly and helplessly. The third picture has the first overlaid on the second and with intense flooding, probably due to the rapid rise in water levels. These pictures have been stuck in my mind for the past three or more years; no idea if I can forget them anytime soon. Maybe it&#8217;s just remnants of some movie visuals, but which?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In totally unrelated thought, my friend was chatting about the concept of hell a couple of weeks ago which I found rather interesting. If Hell is for eternality, what is Hell? Is it the physical suffering, mental torture, or more? However, most things that we experience are relative, just like temperature, pain, and probably suffering. So if it is Hot for the past million years, would it still be hot after another million years? Probably not relatively.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Our emotions, relationships with each other matters only within this life time. Our bonds with our family members are at best transient. After this into eternality, it&#8217;ll probably not matter; there&#8217;s a bigger picture in terms of infinity to matter.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, what is the suffering, &#8220;weeping and gnashing of teeth&#8221;, in Hell that can last for an eternality, making Heaven such an attraction?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>He proposed that it is the eternal separation from the Heavenly Father, once His position as the grand and glorious architect and creator of Heaven and Earth, is revealed. It is similar to a mother forever losing the right to embrace and love her child, only worst â€“ for eternality. Regrets and all, too late.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>On a sunny note, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.R._Bernard']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.R._Bernard">Rev. Dr. A. R. Bernard</a> will be ministering in this weekend&#8217;s services. He introduced the Christ in culture concept to our church and like <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Pringle']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Pringle">Rev. Dr. Phil Pringle</a>, it&#8217;ll be refreshing and exciting, a word in season. I can hardly wait. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
