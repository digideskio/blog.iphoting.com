<p class="whiteline"><p>There are ways to enjoy great (not best) coffee. I love coffee with generous amounts of milk. Without which, it&#8217;s fine too, just that it doesn&#8217;t give the best breath.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>When you&#8217;re short on cash, here&#8217;s what you <em>can</em> do; I&#8217;ll take Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf as an example.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Walk into the shop and buy a regular roast coffee for $2.00. While at it, ask for another empty cup. Then, at the side counter, grab one (plastic) cup of fresh milk, and a fifth cup of Vanilla powder. Sugar, honey, or sweeteners are optional, based on your taste requirements. When you&#8217;ve got all your materials, proceed to your seat.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Here comes the work. Evenly divide the cup of regular roasted coffee between the two glass coffee cups. Then, to each, add half a cup of milk and one tenth cup of vanilla powder. Keep stirring while they are being mixed.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There you go, 2 cups of <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto_latte']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto_latte">Ghetto Latte</a> at $1 a cup. The same applies, albeit the price ($3.40), to Starbucks. However, the ethics of the above actions are left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>On the other hand, I&#8217;ve finished watching season 1 of <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)">House</a>, and I&#8217;m off to Hong Kong this Saturday. Let me know if you want anything from there.</p></p>
