<p class="whiteline"><p>There are many occasions where we think that the current situation seems unfavourable and disastrous on a micro level, without taking account of the macro view and the purpose of the situation. &#8216;&#8220;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&#8221; says the LORD. &#8220;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts.&#8221;&#8217; Isa 55:8-9.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Hence, the only way to go about the situations is to have faith. There&#8217;s a nice illustration in Luke 8:22-25.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="whiteline"><sup>22-24</sup>One day he and his disciples got in a boat. &#8220;Let&#8217;s cross the lake,&#8221; he said. And off they went. It was smooth sailing, and he fell asleep. A terrific storm came up suddenly on the lake. Water poured in, and they were about to capsize. They woke Jesus: &#8220;Master, Master, we&#8217;re going to drown!&#8221;
</p><p class="whiteline">Getting to his feet, he told the wind, &#8220;Silence!&#8221; and the waves, &#8220;Quiet down!&#8221; They did it. The lake became smooth as glass.
</p><p class="whiteline"><sup>25</sup>Then he said to his disciples, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you trust me?&#8221;
</p><p class="break">They were in absolute awe, staggered and stammering, &#8220;Who is this, anyway? He calls out to the winds and sea, and they do what he tells them!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>
