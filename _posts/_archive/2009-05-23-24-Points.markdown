<p class="whiteline"><p>Somedays back, one of my co-workers popped this mathematical question for us to think about. It is fairly simple but complex for our minds. Anyway, here&#8217;s the question:-</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>5 . 5 . 5 . 5 . 5 = 24</p><p class="whiteline">Replace the . with any of the following operators: +, -, *, /. You may add brackets anywhere in-between the numbers or operators.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>There are many solutions, have fun!</p></p>
