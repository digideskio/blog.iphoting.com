<p class="whiteline"><p>You think 3.5k tablets are not a good use of money? (I agree that it&#8217;s a waste of money though). What about the Biological Hub? Aviation Hub? Arts Hub? and insert-your-noun-here hub?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Believe it or not (not Ripley&#8217;s), Singapore is going to have a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.spaceportsingapore.com/']);"  href="http://www.spaceportsingapore.com/">Spaceport</a>!!! I thought it was a joke until CNA carried the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194097/1/.html']);"  href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194097/1/.html">news that Singapore is to have comprehensive spaceport <i>by 2009</i></a>. Am I out of my mind or are they serious?? This is just like <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html']);"  href="http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html">Google&#8217;s Lunar job opportunity</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s like building a Jurassic Park in Singapore. The park in a tiny country is not the main problem, but it still is a problem nonetheless. The main concern is <em>HOW</em> ON EARTH are they going to fill it up with dinosaurs??!!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What&#8217;s more, &#8220;the spaceport will generate three billion dollars in business, and create an additional 5,000 jobs over 10 years&#8221;. Are they <i>really</i> serious?!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m still under the impression that it&#8217;s a combined &#8220;prank&#8221;, Ã  la 1984 (novel). If this is true, I am really at a loss for words. Still, I&#8217;m glad that the 191 million dollars for this &#8216;venture&#8217; is funded by the private sector. I hope I won&#8217;t go deaf then.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>However, this reminded me of today&#8217;s sermon by Rev. Dr. Ulf Ekman - <i>Nothing is impossible, just listen and believe, with faith, <u>GO</u></i>. Catch the sermon later in the week (Thursday) if you can; it&#8217;s just special and deep.</p></p>
