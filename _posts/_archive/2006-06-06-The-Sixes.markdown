<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, many mark this day with their weddings and birthdays; the once-in-a-millennium date never goes unnoticed. They say that something bad is going to happen, but thank God, they weren&#8217;t very good with predictions. That&#8217;s no surprise according to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19375525-29277,00.html']);"  href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19375525-29277,00.html">this article</a>.</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It goes like this, there will be a group of people, 4 to 5 in size, and there will be a person who would be consistently picked on, like a scapegoat. It looks like they have a mutual exploitation pact there.</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That&#8217;s some consolation for eating something bad yesterday and falling sick today.</p>
