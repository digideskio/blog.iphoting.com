<p class="whiteline"><p>The last year came and went; this new year entered without hesitation nor wait. Before the end of this year in a flash again, I shall need to have some changes done to my life.</p>
</p><ol>
<li>I shall not be late for appointments, if I have liberty over it.</li>
<li>I shall start my homework the day it is issued, and not on the last day, regardless of the due date.</li>
<li>I shall not waste time in school and go straight home, as this school is not a place a place to dwell in for the fullness of life.</li>
<li>I shall manage my time with even greater efficiency, avoiding any opportunities of inaction or inactivity.</li>
<li>I shall continue to keep my room as tidy and neat as it is now, despite how unnecessary or frustrating it is to keep it neat.</li>
<li>I shall overcome my collection disorder and throw out all rubbish. Anything that I might need later (apart from school stuff), means the bin shall have it at that very instant.</li>
<li>I shall accept that everyone thinks differently from me and that they would very unlikely see my point of view if ever, regardless of their intelligence.</li>
<li>I shall spend even more time with people, whenever there are opportunities.</li>
<li>I shall apply my perfectionist attitude to all the work that I do, as long as I abide by resolution 2.</li>
<li>I shall not procrastinate in anything that I do, whenever my schedule allows.</li>
<li>I shall tighten my budgeting of my finances even more so that I shall have a large surplus at the end of the year, which I can channel into other investments.</li>
<li>I shall abide by my resolutions.</li>
</ol><p>
</p><p class="break"><p>My ultimate hope is to end the year with 37 points for my IBDP, at least a Silver for PF test, and maintain all relationships while expanding on them.</p></p>
