<p class="whiteline"><p>Today is the eve of a school day. The eve of some &#8216;feast&#8217; related to ToK (Theory of Knowledge). Too many things have happened over the past 3 days and it&#8217;ll be a bore to list every exciting thing down. So, to keep things short and easy for me to type, I shall only write about things that I think that are worthy to talk about.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Buffet is good; but I&#8217;m starting to not be able to take full advantage of opportunities offered during buffets these days. <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.waraku.com.sg/']);"  href="http://www.waraku.com.sg/">Waraku</a> is a nice Japanese restaurant with decent food and decent prices.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The Jurong Regional Library has a rather interesting (interior) design concept. The top floor, teens zone or something to that effect, has really poor furnishing. It&#8217;s as if teens have no taste and will enjoy any form of unpainted, raw concrete space given to them, though many apparently do the last time I&#8217;d visited. Maybe it&#8217;s just the comics section.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This library also houses magazine racks in addition to old books. On one of the racks, I spotted the outstanding and solid FEER (Far East Economic Review) magazines stacked neatly in a pile. Being curious, as I always am, together with enterprise, we went to browse though the covers to look for interesting articles and managed to spot a few. Oh well, for the benefit of illegal circulation, check out <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/feer.com']);"  href="http://feer.com">FEER&#8217;s website</a>. The letters between D &amp; N are quite entertaining reads.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The most amusing thing is a quiet room on the second floor of the building with large glass panels. No idea why a library would require a quiet room, size of a classroom.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The WD replacement drive returned within 24 hours I&#8217;d dropped it off with RMA. That&#8217;s when hell broke loose.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thanks to a combination of factors, my server started to limp badly and unstably once the third harddisk was installed. After some diagnosis, I found out that it was the rack (which was left unused for a year) was spoilt. Replacing it with an older rack allowed the machine to detect the 3rd harddisk. That&#8217;s when nightmares come flowing in, one after another.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Using the &#8216;pvmove&#8217; command when a machine is loaded is totally not recommended unless you need some (wrong) form of excitement (or have too much hair/blood) or you just needed a faith test <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />. Well, that&#8217;s the benefit of retrospection. Then, (to the uninformed,) I moved the &#8216;home&#8217; logical volume off the primary master physical volume onto the primary slave physical volume (3rd drive) so as to reduce load. This 50GB transfer occurred rather smoothly and successfully. I thought this should work fine too for the &#8216;shared&#8217; logical volume and thus, I moved 120GB of &#8216;shared&#8217; logical volume from Pri Master to Sec Master, to unify the partitions, reducing fragmentation due to ever dynamic expansion of the &#8216;shared&#8217; logical volume.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That&#8217;s when load average shot up to 40 plus and severe never returning blocks on basic services. When I see more &#8216;D&#8217;s than 2, and with almost 100% id status and vmstat shows bi/bo of 4 digit values, I know the machine is in trouble, so is my data. I can&#8217;t do anything. I can&#8217;t kill process that are blocked, that includes pvmove. I can only reboot such that the task scheduler doesn&#8217;t explode.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well in short, it took 5 reboots and God&#8217;s touch to fix.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Huh?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yes. Before I left for lunch on Saturday, I gave the machine one last reboot and left the house, giving up on its instability. After all, what can I do? Every little disk operation blocked the application and eventually choking the scheduler, inflating the load averages.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, after lunch and SLS walkabout with CST / VRz guys, I went for cell. Cell was at the most inconvenient time ever. At first, it was supposed to be at 4 pm (which was good), but due to last minute changes, it was brought forward to 3 pm, right smack in the middle of the walkabouts.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Since it&#8217;s so inconvenient and disruptive, I knew that something greater was waiting for me. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> And so it was and is, during praise and worship, &#8220;the server will be fixed when you return home&#8221;. So, please don&#8217;t ask me how I&#8217;d fixed the machine as I&#8217;ve got no idea how. All I knew was to reboot which didn&#8217;t work for the first four and possibly five times.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh well. Got tons of other testimonials but this is probably the most recent one. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I think today&#8217;s sermon was so controversial that it&#8217;s cool. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> The illustrations on how money can&#8217;t be evil; it&#8217;s the LOVE of money that is evil. After all, if money is evil, the devil would bury us in cash, right? Haha. That was the most hilarious yet simple rebuttal ever.</p></p>
