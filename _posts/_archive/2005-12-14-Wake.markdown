<p class="whiteline"><p>Damn. Got awoken by lights, sounds and phone calls. I don&#8217;t even have an opportunity to sleep early and in <em>peace</em>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Got my phone bill for last month and sad to say, I exceeded the basic cost by $14. That&#8217;s really bad. Blasted $9 on exceeded SMS (200 of them) and $4 on GPRS charges. As for my voice talk time usage, it almost exceeded the free area. But still, I&#8217;m glad that I don&#8217;t waste too much money on phone bills; it can be better spent on food, clothes, comp parts, etc. Earning them back is time consuming.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For those of you who don&#8217;t have pure minds, take hightened note of <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/johnlohmr.blogspot.com/2005/12/scary.html']);"  href="http://johnlohmr.blogspot.com/2005/12/scary.html">this</a> clause found in the Interpretation Act (in Singapore).</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="whiteline">When I buy a CD, I look forward to having the lyrics printed in the liner notes. That&#8217;s part of what I expect in exchange for my money. If the record label omits the lyrics, I feel I&#8217;m entirely within my fair use rights to listen closely to the recording and copy down the lyrics. Similarly, I&#8217;m within my fair use rights when I use a search engine to find the lyrics of the music I&#8217;ve legitimately purchased. And thanks to Apple&#8217;s iTunes software, I now can add those lyrics to the digital copies of the music I&#8217;ve purchased and have them appear when the song plays on my iPod.
</p><p class="break">Apparently, at least one music publisher thinks that makes me a music pirate. <b>Yes, annotating music I&#8217;ve legitimately purchased with lyrics makes me a pirate</b>, according to music publishing giant Warner/Chappell. </p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Note: Emphasis by me.</p><p class="whiteline"><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004246.php']);"  href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004246.php">Source</a></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another reason why &#8216;not buying RIAA cds might improve their cd sales&#8217;. Since they always put the blame and punishment on the comsumers, aka customers, I have a tendency to feel that it&#8217;s the comsumers which had done wrong. Only offenders get punished right? What did the comsumers do wrong? They bought RIAA cds. So, to solve this funny but yet stupid problem, we nip the problem in the bud. Id est, consumers should stop doing wrong things (according to RIAA). Consumers should stop making cd purchases and change their music source to the internet.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The benefits are multi-fold. Firstly, you get <em>high-quality</em> DRM-free, aka non-crippled, music for <em>free</em>. Secondly, you solve the problem of committing wrong defined by RIAA as you are no longer being punished for buying original music cds. Thirdly, you encourage more people to listen to various non-obvious artists who need exposure which their labels fail to give. Fourthly, you can safely and convienently rip the tracks into your iPod, without virus vulnerabilities and tiresome and tedious procedures.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Remember, all these for only $0. Now, try that with your original $20 Sony-BMG music cd; and don&#8217;t ever call me for tech support if you happen to insert one of those Sony-BMG cds into your Micro$oft Window$ machines.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Speaking of tech support, check out <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.misterorange.com/2005/12/flipside-8-end-user-troubleshooting.html']);"  href="http://www.misterorange.com/2005/12/flipside-8-end-user-troubleshooting.html">8 End-User Troubleshooting Tips</a>.

</p><p class="break"><p>In the real world, we must push for our rights. Our rights to alight from a train first before others board. We must never be push back into the carriage by overly inconsiderate weight shifters.

If you take the MRT, you better support this or I&#8217;ll push you to the ends of the train and maybe the platform.</p></p>
