As promised, here are a few pictures that I hastily took that I found interesting.

Exhibit A:

No idea, but I thought hanging shoes outside the classroom door might be inauspicious. If not, it looks as if someone got hanged there, just missing skeletons.

Exhibit B:

The perfect route of escape! For those who cannot take the strain of EE or TOK or IA or whatever acronyms you can come up with, feel free to put your neck through the noose for the final solution. No guarantee of success though.

Exhibit C:

I&#8217;m glad the group of student council wannabes have agreed to take over the jobs of the construction companies to bring us a bridge on the fifth floor! Hurray! Whether they deliver their promises is another thing though.

That&#8217;s all that I managed to snap today though, there could be more tomorrow.

For today&#8217;s daily dose of happenings, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that on week B Tuesdays, my class have lessons straight from 8 am to 1 pm, without a break or whatsoever in between. For those of you who don&#8217;t do mathematics, it is 5 hours of uninterrupted lessons, back to back! Of course, this is the finest timetable that the time-tabling committee has ever produced, and the time-tabling committee is always right and is highly competent, second to none. People have got shot for saying otherwise previously. As such, I must offer my heartfelt thanks and congratulations for their hard work that no other can match. I enthusiastically look forward to the next timetable revision.

You know, when student and staff alike requested for shorter school days, the administrators add 20 minutes more of lessons to every subject, every week. When we gave feedback about our hunger, our recesses magically got withdrawn.

Sincerely, I think it&#8217;s reverse psychology at work and it&#8217;s dumb for us to not have noticed it earlier.

So, we should, as a change of strategy, sing great praises and thanks for our new school hours and lesson lengths. Just like the way MPs do to the new budget. Our sleep is absolutely and ultimately worth sacrificing for for that 7 period long mathematics and 7 period long physics lesson (we got today) that our teacher has no idea what to do with them all. So of course, to be much more efficient in this Singaporean edition of IBDP, there are only 24 hours a day and students have decided to do both! Sleep and attend mathematics and physics lessons at the same time to save time!

Anyway, for today, whether a teacher lets us off for recess during his long periods is inconsequential. We would have walked off regardless. A class of hungry and grumpy and sleepy people is not something to be reckoned with.

Oh well, tomorrow will be a better day yet! Marathon from 9.20 am to 1.40 pm (excluding SL2; 4 hr 20 min). If not, it&#8217;ll be 9.20 am to 3.00 pm (5 hr 40 min), straight through jail, do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Amazing if students don&#8217;t fall sick on these days.
