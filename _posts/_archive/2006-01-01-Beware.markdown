<p class="whiteline"><p>If you were to buy music cds from stores, watch for some of the sneeky ways that recording companies like to treat their customers.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Don&#8217;t get what I mean, refer to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.boingboing.net/2006/01/01/coldplays_new_cd_has.html']);"  href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/01/coldplays_new_cd_has.html">this</a> where it says that &#8220;Coldplay&#8217;s new CD has rules: No MP3s, no DVD players, no car stereos&#8221;. Makes me wonder what that cd is for... an expensive coaster anyone?</p></p>
