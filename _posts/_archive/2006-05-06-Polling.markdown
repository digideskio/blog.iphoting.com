<p class="whiteline"><p>Came back from the WP rally, amidst extreme traffic conditions, dead tired. Didn&#8217;t take any decent pictures to put up but the crowds were extreme. The whole Stadium was overflowing with people. The whole 400m track, the surrounding areas and the field within it is full of people, not to mention, any form of stand-able area was used fully. It was also there that I&#8217;d first experienced diagonal road crossing.</p>
