<p class="whiteline"><p>Never have I been so displeased to announce that year 4 and year 5 students are to skip cheering the C-division rugby team in &#8216;a very important finals against Raffles Institution&#8217; for <em>3 hours</em> worth of extra lessons which end at 5.40 pm. The rationale is missing or weak. The First Principle needs to be revisited.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Even the unreliable, unaccountable and irresponsible student is able to point out that quantity does not equate to quality. Even fools are able to point out that students do NOT have attention spans of 2 hours, much less 10 hours. Even my P.E. teacher teaches us that repeatedly trying the standing broad jump test would bring diminishing returns. Professional staff ought to have seen this; or maybe they are all ignored. It quite explains the mass exodus.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This will be a good demonstration of what the school&#8217;s first student council is. This is a testimony of what the school administration is made [out] of. This is the illustration of RED in YELLOW and BLUE.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It appalls me greatly that the root of the problem was never solved nor intended to be solved. Like the speaker said, negative feedback falls on deaf ears.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh very well, I&#8217;m falling sick due to the lack of sleep, pent up stress due to presentations, and additional annoyance of record levels. My absence shall be timely.</p></p>
