<p class="whiteline"><p>A break from writing about my trip. Looking at my last post, I&#8217;m really not suited to describe anything. It explains why I do really badly in descriptive essays a year ago.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yesterday, on my way to lunch, I&#8217;d experienced first hand how horrible buses here are. It&#8217;s not a fragment of my imagination. There&#8217;s this bus that got permanently stuck at 2nd gear as its top gear, even though the lane ahead is clear enough for 2 buses to squeeze through. No idea why the driver likes to do the accelerate, accelerate, brake... accelerate, accelerate, brake... dance on the pedals. Oh wait, did I mention that the bus doesn&#8217;t seem to have its air conditioning functioning properly?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, on my way back home from Sitex today, the bus was filled beyond capacity even though it&#8217;s far from the evening-rush. No idea how they can achieve the 95% capacity figure when it&#8217;s 105% during off-peak hours. PTC needs a direct service hotline, or at least, attempt to make its existence justified other than blindly approving price (upward) adjustments based on half-a-decade old statistics.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, there&#8217;s this joke about GST being raised to 7%. A parliament filled with so many high paying people can only come up with such a solution to help the poor!? Who are they trying to kid? On one hand, raising the GST to &#8220;help the poor&#8221; and on the other hand, reviewing ministar&#8217;s salaries? Downwards is it? Like one of the opposition party members had said, it&#8217;s best to peg the ministar&#8217;s salary to the improvement of the bottom 20% income of the population. And I bet, raising GST wouldn&#8217;t be a solution.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Really. Like somebody told me, some people lose their morals when they are too high up.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Speaking of Sitex, it&#8217;s a complete waste of time, not to mention, space.</p></p>
