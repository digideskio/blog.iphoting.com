<p class="whiteline"><p>Hmm... Schools about to start in like 6 plus days, and 10 minutes earlier too.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Picture this. On the first day of school, anxious parents would be sending the primary ones off to school. Same goes for the secondary ones. Along that narrow 2 lane road named Dover, another additional level (150+/-) of students would be squeezing into it. With a perfect clash with Farfield Primary and Secondary, New Town and Nan Hua Secondary, Anglo-Chinese Junior College and Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) - Years 1 to 5, it amazes me how bus drivers manage to enjoy driving (if they even do in the first place).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As being late is <em>not</em> an option, that leaves being early or to use anything that doesn&#8217;t rely on four wheels. Helicopter rides might just be in great demand.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yep, somebody suggested walking from Dover to school.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>But it&#8217;ll be fun if it rains for the first week of school.</p>
