<p class="whiteline"><p>Cyprian told me that there&#8217;s this new &#8216;honour roll&#8217; for politicians somewhere and he said that prominent and respectable opposition party members are absent. I wanted to check it out but somehow, that list is elusive. I&#8217;ve got to hunt it down some day and capture it down in pixels.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another thing which caught me attention was when Norbert starting touching on ToK and proudly declaring that some of the ToK teachers do not know/understand what they are teaching. Somehow, this matches with my impression that ToK has become a technical subject rather than a subject of expression. Having a &#8216;textbook&#8217; and lecture materials for the ToK subject is fairly useful. It gives us varying perspectives for us to &#8216;hop&#8217; onto. These things called &#8216;reflections&#8217; are funny too. I wonder how the <i>answer scheme</i> looks like. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/tongue.png" alt=":-P" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> It&#8217;s quite weird to have to produce citations for <em>your</em> ideas used in an essay; how nice if I could have an entry: My Mind.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Having not touched English Literature for two years previously, my encounter with it once again reminded me of the reason why I didn&#8217;t take lit last year. Certain lessons, including the way it has been conducted, has made me feel that literature is just another technical subject. As always, there are many good teachers, regardless of the bad, I hope, and I&#8217;m grateful for that.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My trip to the IT Show yesterday, with adventure and enterprise, has been somewhat fruitful, giving me ideas of what to look out for in Shanghai. I got myself a budget iPod charger which works and gave my stomach a lot of work by eating at Carl&#8217;s Junior&#8217;s.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, I&#8217;ve got see how I can raise S$2000 for a MacBook as I need a laptop to satisfy my mobility needs.</p>
