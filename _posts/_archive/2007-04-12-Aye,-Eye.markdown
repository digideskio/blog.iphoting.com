<p class="whiteline"><p>While I was randomly clicking around the web due to the lack of time, I came across this <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/energyrealm.blogspot.com/2007/04/1984.html']);"  href="http://energyrealm.blogspot.com/2007/04/1984.html">post</a>, which I think is the funniest of all. No words can describe it and I suggest that you go read it for yourselves.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Enjoy your great day. Mine&#8217;s abused by World Literature 1st Draft within 24 hours notice. Great!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On the other end of the spectrum, the later part of <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/frozendiary.blogspot.com/2007/04/random-stuff.html']);"  href="http://frozendiary.blogspot.com/2007/04/random-stuff.html">this post</a> made me rather sad, indescribable either.</p>

</p><p class="break"><p>Last but not least, read about this <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/theoneandonlyuncleedna.blogspot.com/2007/04/vive-la-revolution.html']);"  href="http://theoneandonlyuncleedna.blogspot.com/2007/04/vive-la-revolution.html">concept</a> in the form of a post by a wise person.</p></p>
