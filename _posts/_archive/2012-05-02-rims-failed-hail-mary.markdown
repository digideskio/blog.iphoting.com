[Dustin Curtis][source]:

> Despite a complete management overhaul, and several embarrassing delays, nothing has changed. BlackBerry 10 is not a revolutionary operating system. RIM has failed once again.

Dustin on RIM's [radically new camera][1] that lets you step backwards in time after you've taken a photo:

> This is cool, and maybe it's even a worthwhile research project, but who in their right mind, when faced with RIM's current crisis, would spend the resources to design, build, and perfect a camera as complex as that?

End of the day, I don't see how RIM can lastâ€”it seems lost beyond hope.
