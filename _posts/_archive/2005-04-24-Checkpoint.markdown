<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve fixed this blog finally.... After realising that the refers don&#8217;t appear and things seem to be breaking. All these problems, thanks to the MySQL server upgrade. All varchar lengths seem to be square rooted.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve overlooked many things that hold our very existance together. Would I become jobless in future? or would I get to enjoy life more than I do now?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Life&#8217;s greatest ironies is that children love growing up faster while grown ups like going younger. A denial of the world? Or the sight of reality? Ingnorance is a bliss.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My chain of thought has repeatedly been disrupted. I dunno. Is this a sign that I should worry about? Is this a call? Something that I&#8217;ve missed?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>My studies haven&#8217;t been progressing at decent enough speed. I wonder if I can even complete them before those untimely examinations.</p></p>
