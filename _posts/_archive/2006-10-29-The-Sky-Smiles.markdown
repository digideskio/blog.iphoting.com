<p class="whiteline"><p>On our way to Church this morning, the skies smiled brightly as we looked up. What coincidence that I don&#8217;t have a proper camera along with me then. Still, handphone cameras have some use at critical moments. Rest assured, the real view is magnitudes more majestic that what 300k pixles can capture.</p>
