<p class="whiteline"><p>Whoever that was the first to associate crackers with hackers whould have already been shot.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whoever that has been told that hackers are not crackers but choose to ignore it, should be shot.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whoever that has been told that crackers are not hackers but choose to ignore it, should be shot.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whoever that fully reads and comprehend this blog entry but continue to misuse the word hacker, must be shot.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, what exactly is the difference between the two?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Hackers, as defined by the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/']);"  href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/">jargon file</a>, are people who &#8220;program enthusiastically&#8221; and who believe that &#8220;information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources whenever possible&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The latter is also known as the hacker ethic.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, on the wider scale, the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/']);"  href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/">jargon file</a> emphasizes that a hacker is basically &#8220;an expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In other words, hacking can also be seen as a culture; a culture of enthusiasm and freedom of knowledge.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On the other hand, crackers, as defined by the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/']);"  href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/">jargon file</a>, are people who break security on systems; also known as computer criminals.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Therefore, having defined the proper and original definitions of both hacker and cracker, I hope that less people would make this mistake and strengthen the distinction between the two. The power of the ill-knowledged mass media (and people) is just difficult to reverse.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If you would like to learn more about the hacker ethic, go read &#8220;The Hacker Ethic and the spirit of the Information Age&#8221; by Pekka Himanen. Available in all major bookstores. Alternatively, you can borrow the book from me, provided that you pledge to return it to me in an acceptable condition. Or, make <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.google.com/']);"  href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> your friend.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Remember, widespread misconceptions are bad, i.e. the Earth&#8217;s North pole is actually the South and vice-versa. As for the reason, it is left as an exercise for the reader.</p></p>
