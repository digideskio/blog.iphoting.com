<p class="whiteline"><p>Yeah! I got my hands on a (digital) copy of 1984 by George Orwell, finally. It&#8217;s so interesting, doing the exercies that the author has set out for us to do.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this &#8216;personality test&#8217; that described me as &#8220;schizotypal&#8221;. Then, I played with others which provided a different set of results. They cannot be trusted too much. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this person that I&#8217;d met the other day who taught me what it is like to sleep. He described it as an avenue for the mind to release its creativity and/or to solve problems where the consciousness has difficulty solving, id est anything more than the choice of coffee or tea for breakfast.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this &#8216;project&#8217; which I&#8217;ve seen that looked grey in its requirements. Then, it dawned upon me what appraisals are all about. Most non asians don&#8217;t really understand the work culture of the asians. A short life span of about 70 years, spending 70% of it working to earn money, leaving the remaining 90% learning to be competent and the other 10% on a bed. And after 65 years, most Singaporeans don&#8217;t have much money to live and hence they tend to die earlier.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, I&#8217;ve learnt that somebody has realised that as education levels tend to infinity, the result would tend to 1. A universal disclipline - Philosophy.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s not peace around when I tune in to the news of any non-local sort. Makes me wonder if it would escalate to a degree where there&#8217;s no return.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well! Putting things into context, there&#8217;s nothing to worry about; there&#8217;s always sleep.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Think about flying.</p></p>
