<p class="whiteline"><p>Some weeks back, I suggested to one of my friends about conducting some consistent activities to train our brains, so that they don&#8217;t rot so fast while we&#8217;re in NS. Before long, fortnightly <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_bridge']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_bridge">Floating Bridge</a> sessions are started. All who can play float bridge is invited!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Generally, we began with quite some difficulties as we need exactly 4 players at the minimum for a meeting to be successful. After all, national slaves hardly have the time; even if they do, how many would be available for bridge games?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thankfully, we still managed to get at least four people every time for a great game. Unfortunately, some of the people are here on a temporary basis and managing attendance is one of the hardest things to do given the strict limitations of the game.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>That said, it&#8217;s mainly a social gathering. Let me know if you want to join us for some floating bridge games, all who can play, and are willing to contribute effort into playing, are invited. We&#8217;ve got at least 3 decks of cards.</p></p>
