<p class="whiteline"><p>I was asked a grand total of <em>3</em> <em>interesting</em> questions today.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>1) Is there any sound when a log within a dense forest falls and hit the ground?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>2) Why?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>3) What is courage?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>What do you think the answers are? No wrong answers but the point is to have short, sweet and beautiful answers.</p></p>
