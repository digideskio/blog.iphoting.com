<p class="break"><p>Funny isn&#8217;t it when the teacher suddenly announces how ridiculous the student council has become. It&#8217;s one thing to gain fame via unconventional means but it&#8217;s another altogether to do so via means that no one will want to attempt. We have the first council conducting hair checks. This would make us the only pre-university school to have these measures. It is certainly a way to stand out from the crowd, don&#8217;t you think? <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
