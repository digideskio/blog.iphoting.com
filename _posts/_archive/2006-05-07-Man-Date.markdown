<p class="whiteline"><p>The ruling party came back with 66.6%. I hate that number. The opposition, WP, narrowly lost Aljunied GRC with 43.92%. A huge round of applause for the WP! Now, the AMK GRC has been the most amusing of all. 66.13%, 0.47% less than the national average, is considered a strong mandate. Then, what&#8217;s a weak mandate? Losing the GRC?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Speaking of the average overall percentage, without the 70+% in those wards due to SDP, I&#8217;m about to suspect that this might be the second lowest average overall percentage in history.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whoever that could vote and yet voted for the ruling party is really asking for it. Thanks to these people, we&#8217;ve got gradually diminishing civil liberties. I&#8217;m <em>dead</em> serious about it; in fact, it&#8217;s <strong>alarming</strong>. Need proof, read on.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m driving at, I&#8217;m referring to a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_POL_SINGAPORE_POLITICIAN_ARRESTED_ASOL-?TEMPLATE=DEFAULT']);"  href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_POL_SINGAPORE_POLITICIAN_ARRESTED_ASOL-?TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">Singapore opposition politician arrested for allegedly threatening election officials</a>. I sincerely hope you know who that refers to. For alleged &#8220;criminal intimidation&#8221;?! Goodness. Let&#8217;s see if the ST or CNA reports it. &#8220;Fix&#8221;ing the opposition eh?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This quite explains why Dr Chee behaves the way he does.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I hope some international body intervenes before it&#8217;s too late.</p></p>
