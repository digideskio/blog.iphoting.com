<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I&#8217;ve seen the disgusting side of a bureaucracy, again. From backstabing, lying, cheating and by-passing to out right &#8220;stealing&#8221; and opacity.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I was told that my CCA has &#8220;ran-out-of-funds&#8221; when we have <em>NOT even used a single cent</em> that we&#8217;d budgeted for. This happened <em>even</em> with a budget stating the needs, which had not been rejected based on my understanding. It&#8217;s not that they are poor and that they really don&#8217;t have money but it&#8217;s that it has been <em>misused</em> or <em>mismanaged</em> in my <i>opinion</i>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Annoying is a compliment. Expressing my real feelings and thoughts would have been too vulgar and french-like. Furthermore, this <em>isn&#8217;t</em> the first time I&#8217;ve <i>experienced</i> it.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>And to whoever that reads this, don&#8217;t you dare charge me for slander. Yes, I&#8217;m pissed.</p></p>
