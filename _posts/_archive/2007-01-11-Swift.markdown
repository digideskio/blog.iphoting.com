<p class="whiteline"><p>I always find myself grumbling about stupid things like being cornered into an LT during our free periods where we&#8217;re supposed to use it to do EE and ToK without any working wireless internet connection in school and no access to proper library books. Brilliant!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, I was told to collect the EAGLES award thing but the administrator insists that I return after school with the letter. Another day then. Money comes when I need it, I thank God. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For those of you who are going on the OEP, remember to enjoy yourselves with the company and maybe the cold. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> It&#8217;s one of the best bonding sessions that the school can provide, never-mind the increased costs.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The Apple iPhone looks good, works good according to Jobs, and is well priced if no strings attached. Sadly, it&#8217;ll only appear in Asia&#8217;s shelves in 2008. Well, it gives us some time to save up and watch them iron out some kinks. A phone can&#8217;t have random shutdown issues right? <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I think it&#8217;ll take up to the following week before our internet connections allow us to watch Jobs&#8217; RDF in action. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>It quite amazes me how analysts come up with <em>predicted</em> sales figures and targeted share prices.</p></p>
