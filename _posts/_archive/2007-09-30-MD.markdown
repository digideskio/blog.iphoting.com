<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m quite happy. I&#8217;m recovering and managed to finish a bowl of noodles by myself without needing help nor puking it all out. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In other (outdated) news, House MD Season 4 has finally started running since last Tuesday. The sarcastic jokes are still just as good. Then, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.theage.com.au/news/world/web-of-cash-power-and-cronies/2007/09/28/1190486569946.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1']);"  href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/web-of-cash-power-and-cronies/2007/09/28/1190486569946.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1">this article</a> talks about the economic relationship that Singapore has with Burma. Speaking of which, it reminds me of <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/singaporemind.blogspot.com/2007/09/country-in-sad-sad-state.html']);"  href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2007/09/country-in-sad-sad-state.html">this post</a> by Lucky Tan, about the tense political situation of a certain country.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s pretty sad.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Couple of weeks back, I was wondering if there&#8217;s a place where people are not critical and that there are no commentaries running about anything, as they are &#8216;highly unproductive&#8217; and &#8216;pointless&#8217;. Then, it occurred to me. Singapore has been the place all along. Looking at the newspapers yield no valuable discerning commentary on notable and significant issues. All debates about the CPF and other issues by the press are ridiculously one-sided. Foreign press are kept out from commenting, so are independent analysts and policy studies professors in the country, leaving the internet the only viable medium for the informed and initiated. Local columnists who write about &#8216;bread and butter&#8217; issues got banned, almost instantly.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Seriously, I&#8217;m scared. The state could just as easily pull an <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933">enabling act</a> and no one would bother to protest nor debate about the &#8216;possible side-effects&#8217; and or downsides of such draconian action. But you know, I&#8217;m probably crazy. No one would believe such things would happen. In fact, many in the British Cabinet in 1930s refused to believe that WWII was inevitable either.</p></p>
