<blockquote><p class="break">Love is patient; love is kind</p><p class="break">and envies no one.</p><p class="break">Love is never boastful, nor conceited, nor rude;</p><p class="break">never selfish, not quick to take offense.</p><p class="break">There is nothing love cannot face;</p><p class="break">there is no limit to its faith,</p><p class="break">its hope, and endurance.</p><p class="break">In a word, there are three things</p><p class="break">that last forever: faith, hope, and love;</p><p class="break">but the greatest of them all is love.</p><p class="break">(1 Cor 13)</p></blockquote>
