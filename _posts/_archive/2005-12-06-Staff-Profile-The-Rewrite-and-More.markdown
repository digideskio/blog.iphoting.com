<p class="whiteline"><p>Started work on a new version of the ACSi Staff Profile on Monday (05 Dec, 2005). Finally finished it, with additional features, this afternoon. I took approxmately 10 hours to finish this project; shorter than I&#8217;d expected myself.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For a sneak preview of the qa-in-progress Staff Profile, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/cst2.acnova.com/~staff-profile/v2/']);"  href="http://cst2.acnova.com/~staff-profile/v2/">click here</a>. Teachers, although it&#8217;s tempting to start modifying your profile, but HOLD YOUR HORSES. If you&#8217;re keen to beta test, feel free to do so and report any bugs to me via my email address.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>New features, in addition to what it can already do:-</p><p class="break">- Personal Profile only Edit for password holders.</p><p class="break">- Lost Password recovery.</p><p class="break">- Change Password.</p><p class="break">- Picture text (read: description), in addition to icon text.</p><p class="whiteline">- Automatic and transparent image resize function, to 160px for pictures and 100px for icons. (the px refers to the longest side of the image, while maintaining its aspect ratio) Note: size is customisable in one of the variables.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Started clearing out my room. Plenty of rubbish (read: Chinese) that I threw out without much thought. Got a stack of O Level books here but I&#8217;ve decided to keep them for 2 years before newer materials supersceed their existence.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.jinx.com/scripts/details.asp?affid=-1&amp;amp;productID=285']);"  href="http://www.jinx.com/scripts/details.asp?affid=-1&amp;productID=285">Toilet paper</a> for your everyday needs.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>10 more days to the release of pre-university posting results. I wonder what awaits. Can&#8217;t wait to buy the 15" PowerBook though; but I&#8217;m patient.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And, something that everyone&#8217;s been asking for, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.acnova.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=6427#6427']);"  href="http://www.acnova.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=6427#6427">The Educator</a>, in its second and third parts.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Looks like I&#8217;ll be real busy for the whole of this week; building comps and attending the LanParty.</p></p>
