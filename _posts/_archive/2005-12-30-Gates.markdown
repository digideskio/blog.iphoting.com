<p class="whiteline"><p>Goodness... It&#8217;s 3 days to the new beginning of the acadamic year. In what a shocking speed that the holidays have sped away. Of course, being mentally prepared of the traffic mess, I&#8217;ve looked up other driving alternatives available in case Dover Road clogs up severely. I&#8217;m looking at AYE where there are bus stops right behind the school. Isn&#8217;t it a good place to disembark from a car? The only problem is whether the gate is open at the appropriate times.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Lately, the &#8220;news&#8221; on television doesn&#8217;t feel like news anymore. The definition of news that I&#8217;m referring to is CNN/BBC types, NOT &#8216;good-to-know information&#8217;, like how residents are happy that a <i>certain</i> MRT station is open and how much less walking they used to have to suffer.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>More important news such as the need for retrenchment and that pilots need more flexible pay packages.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, I think <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/godwin.ralert.net/blog/archives/2005/12/nothing_here_bu.html']);"  href="http://godwin.ralert.net/blog/archives/2005/12/nothing_here_bu.html">this</a> is real <em>cool</em>. How nice to have an exercise/notebook which behaves this way.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;d just found out that the &#8216;Bridge&#8217; that was commonly played in Singapore is called (surprise surprise), <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_bridge']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_bridge">Singaporean Bridge</a>. Though I somewhat know how contract Bridge is played, I somehow still find Singaporean Bridge more entertaining.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Palm, wake up! Start focusing on what needs to be done and not anything else. PalmSource, speed up! The PocketPCs are getting too far ahead and please make an attempt to start catching up. None of Palm&#8217;s products released lately are breath-taking or are worth looking at. Wait till Apple releases handhelds once again and we&#8217;ll have one less competitor for Micro$oft.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Looks like the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051229-5863.html']);"  href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051229-5863.html">Sony rootkit issue is getting settled</a>. Lawyers in Singapore, do something! Consumer rights need to be protected. If not, there&#8217;s hardly any &#8216;rights&#8217; left for Singaporeans.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And I feel that <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.armaniexchange.com/']);"  href="http://www.armaniexchange.com/">Armani Exchange</a> have beautiful clothing designs.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m glad that selected MTVs are available on Google Video. Check out these <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/video.google.com/videosearch?q=hollywood+records+jesse+mccartney']);"  href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=hollywood+records+jesse+mccartney">MTVs by Jesse McCartney</a>.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Before reaching the gates of Heaven, better take note of <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/performancing.com/node/644']);"  href="http://performancing.com/node/644">this</a>.</p></p>
