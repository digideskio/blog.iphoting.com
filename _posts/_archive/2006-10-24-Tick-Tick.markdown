<p class="whiteline"><p>Now that everything is slowly grinding to a halt, other things are now starting to move. The school term and year has once again moved to a close; last minute administrative and homework related work is being hurried on. School these days is really boring. Card game can only entertain up to certain hours. Anything more would require a lot more attention span and concentration which I&#8217;ve yet to muster.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m getting bored. I need to dabble in stuff which I&#8217;d once avoided due to school work commitments. Music? Programming? Thinking? Sleeping? Shopping?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Went to the Converse warehouse sale and bought 2 pairs of shoes, white and black. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Spotted a few more funky and nice ones but they went out of stock for sizes I want. Being lazy, as I&#8217;m always, I won&#8217;t go hunting for them in the boutiques.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The RSF has once again released the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=639']);"  href="http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=639">annual Press Freedom Index</a> and I&#8217;m thoroughly disappointed. After so much work by the government, Singapore Press has only been ranked 146th. It&#8217;s barely 150th, not to mention North Korea&#8217;s 168th ranking. Looks like they need to put in more effort in order for the Press here to hit 150th position. Year 2010 might be a good year.</p>
