<p class="whiteline"><p>This morning&#8217;s soccer (football) match was the longest that I&#8217;ve watched (not that I&#8217;ve watched many). Haha... Italy won, as I thought.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That aside, our illustrious alumni, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/miyagi.sg/']);"  href="http://miyagi.sg/">Mr Miyagi</a>, has announced that &#8220;today I told TODAY that I quit&#8221;. He has joined ranks with another alumni, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.mrbrown.com']);"  href="http://www.mrbrown.com">Mr Brown</a>, in not working for TODAY anymore. For this, despite the fact that &#8220;TODAY money is nice and secure&#8221;, and yet they stood by their principles, I take my hat(s) off to them.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1344513&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;pp=15']);"  href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1344513&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15">SAF restructuring to trim up to 250 staff</a> and the report that they have to increase service duration from 2 years to 2 year 4 months due to shortage of manpower doesn&#8217;t make sense. Oh well, since when do they make sense anyway.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In my blog digg today, I&#8217;ve found <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/gigamuddirr.blogspot.com/']);"  href="http://gigamuddirr.blogspot.com/">this</a>. Read it when you have nothing to do or need some (different) humour.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Meanwhile, please help my friend in completing this <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=udkj9i7n0azc5ea205741']);"  href="http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=udkj9i7n0azc5ea205741">quick and simple survey</a> for his project.</p></p>
