<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m saddened by the fact that the MDA have introduced <i>more</i> <em>ratings</em> for movies, allowing viewers &#8220;more&#8221; <i>choice</i>, which in fact is counter-intuitive.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Let&#8217;s see... We now have:-</p><p class="break">G</p><p class="break">PG</p><p class="break">NC16</p><p class="break">M18</p><p class="whiteline">R21</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, more films are now being classified under NC16 since this new level was introduced. What about people who are just below the age of 16? Do they have a choice to watch a given movie, with or without relevent cuts? It looks like young people have less choices when choosing a movie. The last the I&#8217;d visited a Cinema, out of the 5 movies available, 4 are rated NC16. The other, Millions, was rated at PG.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, let&#8217;s see. Had NC16 not existed, films would be mostly PG with cuts. Which means that a 15-year old would have 5 out of 5 films to choose from. However, he has only <em>one</em> <i>official</i> choice currently.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The least that they could do to offer <em>more</em> viewing choices to cinema goers, would be to allow parallel screening of movies, i.e. PG and NC16, for those that are rated NC16. They need not run at the same time but they should be available around the same time frame.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>That way, I&#8217;m sure all of you can see, would provide consumers with <i>more</i> <em>choices</em> in what they like to watch. I&#8217;m quite <em>confident</em> that many people have <i>sufficient</i> <em>intellectual capacity</em> to make <i>informed decisions</i> of their given viewing choices.</p></p>
