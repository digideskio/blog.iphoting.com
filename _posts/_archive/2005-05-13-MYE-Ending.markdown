<p class="whiteline"><p>Great! My exams, except for Biology and Geography Paper 1, is over. I can finally get some rest and start planning for my Prelim/O Level preparations.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To all of the superstitious people out there, it&#8217;s Friday the 13th today. Good luck to all your endevours today. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve got this new game, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.codemasters.com/colinmcrae2005/']);"  href="http://www.codemasters.com/colinmcrae2005/">Colin Mcrae Rally 2005</a>, from my friend.

</ol><p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Also, this is a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/statutes.agc.gov.sg/']);"  href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/">nice site</a> to read up on Laws and Acts of the Singapore Legal system.</p></p>
