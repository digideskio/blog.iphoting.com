<p class="whiteline"><p>Office politics is something that every white collar and some blue collar workers have to battle through. School is the safest place to try your hand at this game. School provides immunity being students and while allowing manipluations behind the scenes.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I feel more weary and worn as times go. I&#8217;m less sharp on matters and at times, I&#8217;d even overlooked some obvious stuff. 2 weekends and 5 weekdays is just not proportionate, not at all.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Now, my mind is so exhausted that I don&#8217;t know what else to write.</p></p>
