<p class="whiteline"><p><img width='640' height='480' border='0' hspace='5' src='http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/uploads/Computers/iPod/iPodMiniBox1.jpg' alt='' /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Having owned an <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/ipod/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/ipodmini/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/">Mini</a> for more than a week, I can finally experience <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>&#8217;s true quality. The overall presentation of their products is exceptionally good, from the packaging to the wrapping; all fufilling Apple&#8217;s theme that they are trying to protray.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Enough of praise that everyone has already heard it in one way of the other. Now, to my critique.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The iPod Mini that I&#8217;d got from a competition, has only 4GB capacity. Even with the 6GB capacity, I still feel that it&#8217;s too small. <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/ipod/color/autosync.html']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/color/autosync.html">Automatic music management</a> is not available for me as it&#8217;ll burst my iPod. My next best shot would be Automatic Playlist management.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Even so, creating lists is tedious and is made harder by <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/itunes/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>&#8217; terrible Library interface. That interface is good when you have &lt; 500 tracks in your library, but with a library of 2000++ tracks, it gets clumsy (did I already mention slow?). Maybe the slowness is due to my collection of music living on my network <em>but</em> the slowness didn&#8217;t seem to appear in Windows Media Player (for once). I just somehow feel that iTunes is somewhat badly coded or poorly optimised or both. The occassionally sluggish response to clicks and drags is enough to get on my nerves. With iTunes 5, it gets even slower.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The sound quality on the iPod Mini is not as good as <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.real.com/realmobile/palmone.html']);"  href="http://www.real.com/realmobile/palmone.html">RealOne player</a> on my <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.palm.com/']);"  href="http://www.palm.com/">Palm</a>. Can you believe it? I refuse to do so, but I&#8217;m thankful that I didn&#8217;t pay for an iPod. Ok... maybe iTunes down-sampled my music without my knowledge while being transfered? Or it&#8217;s just one of the energy saving features that made the sounds amplification so weak (audible, or the lack thereof, only through stereo speakers).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>All in all, despite the short falls of the iPod, I still prefer it to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.creative.com/']);"  href="http://www.creative.com/">Creative</a>&#8217;s range of players.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Guess what, Apple has released an iPod <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/ipodnano/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">Nano</a>. The capacity is still something that leaves much to be desired. In fact, it has gone worst. With 2GB and 4GB models, I think they are targeting new comers to the mp3 world. And no, don&#8217;t talk about the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">shuffle</a>, I don&#8217;t wanna hear about it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><hr />
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh yah, one more thing. <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.gnome.org/']);"  href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.gnome.org/start/2.12/']);"  href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.12/">2.12</a> is released. Check it out, I&#8217;d read that there have been quite a number of worthy improvements.</p></p>
