<p class="whiteline"><p>Went to Tampines Mall, looked for the shop which prints mousepads and found it missing. Wasted time and called Yellow Pages City Search at 1900-7777777.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>They too took 30min just to give me a printing shop in Singapore, not even near the east...</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>This is getting difficult. I guess I&#8217;ll just call the shop up and see if they have such rare services...</p></p>
