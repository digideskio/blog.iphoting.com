<p class="whiteline"><p>Yesterday, I was prompted to buy this book, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/worldcat.org/isbn/0785261168']);"  href="http://worldcat.org/isbn/0785261168">Drawing Near by John Bevere</a>. Man, it was difficult. Knowing God, if there&#8217;s a difficulty in doing something He recommends, it is bound to be beneficial, albeit the sacrifices. I had to go to different bookshops at the most inconvenient time, but it was worth all the money and time I&#8217;d spend getting and reading this book.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In all, it is an extremely good and important read (for me and for my breakthrough). If you are interested, feel free to borrow it from me (I&#8217;ve finished reading it in one sitting), but preferably that you have had some basic Bible study prior to reading this.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Have a great week 10 ahead, God bless!</p></p>
