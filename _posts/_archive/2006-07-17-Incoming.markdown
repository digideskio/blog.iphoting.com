<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m quite bemused by school, despite my four years as a stakeholder of this establishment. I&#8217;m under the impression that the common test wasted 2 weeks, or more (for those who&#8217;d studied harder than before), of our precious time during this IA intensive month; gave us more stress that we need for us to dissipate; and did I mention wasted our time?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This month, the number of performances we are recommended to go for stands at a mighty 3. Haven Musical, Philharmonic Orchestra Concert and Battle of the bands. $15, $10, $10, respectively. I will gladly pay for them as long as the money end up where they were advertised to go.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s another thing that I&#8217;ve picked up lately â€” Regulation without Relation equals to Rebellion.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The most amusing thing I&#8217;ve heard today was that the admin office glass panels can&#8217;t be used to paste up our EE placement schedule as there are visitors around.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>It just amazes me how draining school can be. Within the first 3 hours of morning, I can feel the exhaustion setting in, extinguishing any form of enthusiasm I need for the rest of the day.</p></p>
