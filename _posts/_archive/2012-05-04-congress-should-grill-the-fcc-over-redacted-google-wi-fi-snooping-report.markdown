Chris Soghoian, writing for [Wired][source], on the role of FCC in this farce:

> However, even if the FCC lacked the legal authority punish Google, nothing prevented the agency from alerting the public, the media, and Congress to the full extent of Googleâ€™s sins. Instead, the agency opted to keep the public in the dark.

> The FCC has yet to reveal the reasons why it opted to so heavily redact the most damning portions of the Google WiFi report. Congress should not wait for the FCC to volunteer an explanation. It should demand answers.

The US regulators have time and again cited bureaucratic reasons to absolve themselves of doing what regulators are there for.

Remember the [SEC][] in the [Madoff scandal][scandal]?
