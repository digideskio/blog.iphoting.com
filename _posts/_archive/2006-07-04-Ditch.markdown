<p class="whiteline"><p>On my way home on the train, I spotted new CCTVs installed in each carriage. In fact, there are 3 in each carriage. It makes me wonder why Singaporeans can take this breach of privacy so lightly, as light as the 50 to 100% increase in taxi fares. Maybe there isn&#8217;t a lot of people who take taxis. Nevertheless, taxi companies can expect that to be or become true given their love for money.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>While I was stoning on the train, somewhat deep in thought, I was suddenly inspired to look up Revelations 7. The verse was not stated and hence, I expect the boundary to be rather ambiguous. Referring to my trusty palm (PDA), the Bible reader was coincidentally left at chapter 7 when I navigated to Revelations (every book has its own bookmark). I read through and found significance in this verse (Rev 9:6), &#8220;In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t found what the exact meaning is or for whom.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;This is the day the LORD has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, I pray, O LORD; O LORD, I pray, send now prosperity.&#8221; - Ps 118:24-25.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With that, I shall collapse onto bed.</p></p>
