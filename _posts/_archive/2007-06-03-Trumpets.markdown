<p class="whiteline"><p>Back from a 5 hour long service and am totally exhausted as I haven&#8217;t woken up late for the past week. In a couple of hours, I&#8217;ll be flying off to Hong Kong to mark the beginning of the school holidays.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, my pastor talked about the Trumpet â€“ the last trumpet shall sound and the end will come. The trumpet symbolises the Jubilee in the Old Testament; it symbolises the Gospel in the New Testament. The trumpet has been passed down from Moses to Isaac, prophets and all the way to the angels, to Jesus, to Paul and then to John; then to Martin Luther, John Wesley and then onwards and now, to the people of our generation.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In 25 years possibly, within our life time, the gospel can be preached in all the world, and possibly three quarters of the world population become believers based on extrapolation of current statistics. Like what Matthew 24:14 says, &#8220;And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s really close.</p>
