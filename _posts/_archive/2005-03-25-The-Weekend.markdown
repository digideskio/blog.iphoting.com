<p class="whiteline"><p>Faced with 6 A. Maths assignments, I&#8217;m not happy nor pleased.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Apparently, the lessons has increased in speed, so much that I&#8217;m starting to feel &#8220;just-right&#8221;. Strangely, despite the misunderstanding or lack thereof, the pace was not reduced... Bad time management? Or is it my fault?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well... 4 Chapters to be covered in 4 weeks. I wish my classmates and myself the best of luck.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The Mid-years, the determinent of the amount to pay for June study camps, is approaching. I&#8217;ll will do my best to avoid it.</p></p>
