[NYTimes][source]:

> Google’s harvesting of e-mails, passwords and other sensitive personal information from unsuspecting households in the United States and around the world was neither a mistake nor the work of a rogue engineer, as the company long maintained, but a program that supervisors knew about, according to new details from the full text of a regulatory report.

Another indication that one must never trust Google—they are economical with honesty and truth. If you're planning on putting your files onto Google Drive, you might want to think again.
