<p class="whiteline"><p>Had a farewell party for Brutus and we had lots of fun with lateral thinking games. From &#8216;how many <i>meah meah</i> jumped over the wall&#8217; to &#8216;black magic&#8217; and from &#8216;bang bang bang; who died&#8217; to &#8216;<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/crux.baker.edu/cdavis09/roses.html']);"  href="http://crux.baker.edu/cdavis09/roses.html">petals around the rose</a>&#8217;. Of course, the latter game was introduced by yours truly. The problem is that there wasn&#8217;t a set of 5 dices available and we had to result in drawing dice faces; there went the bulk of the fun. Based on general consensus, petals around the rose is the most challenging game. There are plenty of smart people around, I&#8217;m glad. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>

More specifically, he talked about an instance of a person who had to pay under 10k for a taste of American chicken soup, independent from any middlemen or resellers. I refuse to comment on the quality of the soup or its distribution methods.</p>
