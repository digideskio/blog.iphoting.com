<p class="whiteline"><p>Today was quite cool. Pastor Phil came to church to minister, but this time it was different. He painted a cross with Jesus with a tilted perspective on the huge canvas (roughly 2.5 m by 2 m) while preaching, and really, he&#8217;s quite good with using paint textures to bring out depth and detail. Through the use of blue, brown and white colours and the occasional dab of orange, red, and yellow, a very solemn yet hopeful scene is shown. Amusingly, he signed his name on the canvas first before he started, increasing the stakes of any severe mistakes. I&#8217;ll try to get a picture when church posts the sermon replays.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The last painting he painted (The Last Supper) at the previous service was sold for $50,000, and of course the money got donated back to church.</p>

It was brilliantly good and filled with great anointing. Throughout her whole &#8216;performance&#8217;, presence of God continued to be around and it was simply amazing.</p>
