<p class="whiteline"><p>Yesterday, I forgot to mention all things that I&#8217;ve observed in this daily life. The chemistry of an organisation is quite important. I find it quite alarming that there are times when the pair of hands refuse to do what the brain orders it to do. Upon further ultimatums by the brain, against the professional advice of the pair of hands, orders the pair of hands to go ahead and do what the brain demands.</p>
