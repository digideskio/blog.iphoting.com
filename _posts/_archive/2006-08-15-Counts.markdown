<p class="whiteline"><p>Here we go again; 6 brooms and 6 dustpans. Is the concept of over supply so difficult to understand??!! Quantity does not equate to Quality! We want <em>mops</em> and <em>pails</em> so that we can wash the floor clean of dust, not more brooms to sweep dust from left to right; there&#8217;s enough dust flying around already! A vacuum cleaner might be better too.</p>
