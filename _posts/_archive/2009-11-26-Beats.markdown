<p class="whiteline"><p>As I&#8217;ve have been listening to dance remixes, I always wondered how DJs transition and mix between each track, while maintaining the tempo at a constant. Obviously, with technology these days, it isn&#8217;t that difficult but still requires some bit of skill. Imagine the days of turntables and a mixer board only.</p>
