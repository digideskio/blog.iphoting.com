<p>Recently, an <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/14-old-girl-hit-mrt-train-20110403-004605-147.html']);"  href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/14-old-girl-hit-mrt-train-20110403-004605-147.html">unfortunately accident</a> occurred at Ang Mo Kio MRT train station. A fourteen-year-old girl lost both of her legs when she felt drowsy and fell onto the tracks.</p>

<p>The most recent development has it that the teen&#8217;s family <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/thai-teen-family-sues-smrt-3-4-million-050028884.html']);"  href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/thai-teen-family-sues-smrt-3-4-million-050028884.html">is sueing</a> SMRT for S$3.4 million dollars. The damages requested are to cover the cost for &#8220;a new pair of custom-made legs every three to five years, depending on how fast she grows and rate of wear and tear&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also noticed a huge outcry among netizens claiming that SMRT is not at fault and that the damages requested is far too outrages.</p>

<p>Given that SMRT has only assisted the family with a &#8220;goodwill&#8221; of S$5000 for the family&#8217;s medical expenses, far from sufficient to cover <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110614-0000069/Girl-who-lost-both-legs-in-MRT-accident-returns-to-Thailand']);"  href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110614-0000069/Girl-who-lost-both-legs-in-MRT-accident-returns-to-Thailand">S$46,000 chalked up at Tan Tock Seng</a>, I think the family has the right to ask for more. Based on the calculations offered in the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/thai-teen-family-sues-smrt-3-4-million-050028884.html']);"  href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/thai-teen-family-sues-smrt-3-4-million-050028884.html">second article</a>, the damages requested looked reasonable and <em>foreseeable</em>.</p>

<p>My honest opinion has it that the way SMRT behaved, to abstain from all liability and responsibility in this accident, was extremely irresponsible. To begin with, this is a real accident as the victim fell onto the tracks unintentionally, making this situation different from suicide incidents. The least SMRT could do is to just cover all her medical expenses and a little more and the case will close quietly. Now, it is a Public Relations (PR) nightmare for them, for being on the wrong side of ethics.</p>

<p>Although I have to disclaim that I am not a qualified lawyer, I  believe that SMRT is negligent in this case. It is only reasonable for the family to sue SMRT for their rightful damages, not for momentary profit, but to cover their medical, loss of earnings, and other <em>foreseeable</em> expenses.</p>

<p>The next big question that people would wonder is, does SMRT have a duty of care towards its passengers? Definitely! They are even liable if you trip and fall and injure yourselves in their stations and trains, what more getting hit by an oncoming train. Foreseeable? Of course! They&#8217;re finally installing platform gates now, albeit too late.</p>

<p>Certainly, there are more factors in handling <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.singaporelaw.sg/content/Negligence.html']);"  href="http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/Negligence.html">negligence</a>: duty of care, breach, causation, and remoteness, but I&#8217;ll leave detailed qualifications to the courts to decide. Nonetheless, having thought about it, the victims (plaintiff) should have a reasonable chance of succeeding in their claims. It&#8217;s a matter of public policy considerations and the amount of damages.</p>

<p>Hence, I offer no sympathy to SMRT. For a company that is raking in hundreds of millions of profits annually for offering a public service, it definitely has the resources to &#8220;do the right thing&#8221;, but ultimately dropped the ball.</p>

<p>They ought to be sued.</p>
