<p class="whiteline"><p>Went to SimLim Square to buy a 250GB harddisk to supersceed my 120GB one. On my way there on the train, I saw a pair of twins, approxmately 1 to 2 years of age, fighting in the middle of the carriage. It&#8217;s somewhat violent. So much so that one of them ended up crying out in pain. Suprisingly, the (boys&#8217;) father did little/nothing to stop/separate them.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Maybe it&#8217;s an overdose of &#8220;power rangers&#8221; or equivalent. Or maybe, it&#8217;s because they are twins. It&#8217;s said that twins are somewhat more suicidal then others.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I hope this 250GB Western Digital harddisk can satisfy my storage needs in the times to come.</p></p>
