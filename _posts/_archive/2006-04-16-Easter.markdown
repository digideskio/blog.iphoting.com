<p class="whiteline"><p>Easter, the Resurrection of Jesus three days after his Crucifixion; the most important and most joyous holiday on the Christian calendar. &#8220;Go to all theological guru&#8217;s tombs and see if they are empty&#8221;.  Amen.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Lately, the news papers are overflowing with propaganda such that I&#8217;m under the impression that should any opposition party receive such &#8216;news&#8217; coverage in the papers, it&#8217;ll be deemed a violation of some act. This biasness has got to stop. For a paper which writes about how good itself is in the world, I wonder.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On the other hand, Today seems to be a tad cleaner.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, I&#8217;ve finally got my IOP topic after spending a hot afternoon outside the Singapore Indoor Stadium yesterday.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Looking at the council nominees&#8217; write-ups, I roughly have a rough idea on what the 1st Council would look like and what major achievements we can expect to see. It looks like 15 votes each is too many.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Happy Easter!</p></p>
