<p class="whiteline"><p>Without a shadow of doubt, I have more than a few things to say given my long absence here.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The purpose of this blog is about to be fulfilled and after completing this last thing, I&#8217;ll have to make a decision on whether to close it or to determine a new direction. This isn&#8217;t my first blog, but it&#8217;s one of the longest running ones around, carrying a mix of school, computing, movies, and generic social commentary, with the ultimate aim of improving my English writing skills. Now that I&#8217;ve almost graduated, it&#8217;s done. Well, I could always continue scurrying the web for interesting developments, but I doubt if I can keep up with these developments myself, much less post them.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Testimonials are calling for themselves to be written, and I guess this post has to end here.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>This is thus my 627th post.</p></p>
