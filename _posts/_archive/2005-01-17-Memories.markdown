<p class="whiteline"><p>The past. Flooded me with emotions, happiness, sadness. Every vision, a thousand words. A thousand words, countless memories.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I remember the times when we had fun.</p><p class="break">I remember the times when we were down.</p><p class="break">I remember the times when, there was not much;</p><p class="whiteline">Fun we sought for, life&#8217;s prime - wasted.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I remember the days when we were lost;</p><p class="break">we were found.</p><p class="break">I remember the days when we were pressured;</p><p class="break">but we survived.</p><p class="break">I remember the days when we had success together;</p><p class="whiteline">but failures were rampant.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I remember.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>We have come so far,</p><p class="break">In many different ways we have showned;</p><p class="whiteline">The creativity, immense strength and vigor - The Essence of Childhood.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The pranks we had played.</p><p class="break">The teachers who were mad.</p><p class="break">The &#8220;family&#8221; of friends who made it all possible.</p><p class="break">The &#8220;friends&#8221; of teachers who made is not-so-possible.</p><p class="break">The laughter when we had &#8220;made it&#8221;.</p><p class="whiteline">The silence when it had &#8220;fell through&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Those were the times, the very days;</p><p class="whiteline">The foundation of life and the very test of friendship.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>You are the strength when I am weak</p></p>
