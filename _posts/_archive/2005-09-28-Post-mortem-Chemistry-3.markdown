<p class="whiteline"><p>My post-silence as of late was due to my not-so-pinkness of health and my addiction over sleeping marathons. Meaning, School, sleep, dinner, sleep, school, sleep, etc. Approxmately 14 hours a day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I had the <i>best</i> (prelim) paper review yet. Chemistry paper 3 by Alistair Chew. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, the QA for this paper was extremely complex, being &#8220;top 3 compared to O-Level Papers in difficulty&#8221; and &#8220;top 5 in ACSi&#8221;. Also, the ACSi (past and present) chemistry practical papers were said to be the defending champions in &#8220;The Best Chemistry Practical Paper Award&#8221;, from some tuition centre, for 8 consecutive years. Needless to say, the teacher who set this paper, none other than A. Chew, is truly a genius or better than one. A round of applause please.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Although &#8220;Copper (II) ions <em>never</em> appeared in the reactant, we still <em>award</em> you the mark for identifying Cu<sup>2+</sup> as an ion for <em>falling</em> into the blue dye trick&#8221;. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/eek.png" alt=":-O" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> was my response to that, but I didn&#8217;t make any protest because I&#8217;d gotten the mark for this. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On the other hand, I found this article, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050922-5339.html']);"  href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050922-5339.html">When playing a CD becomes a &#8220;privilege,&#8221; not a right</a>, amusing.</p>
