<p class="whiteline"><p>Went to school today to collect <i>form A</i> and a booklet on how to register for a JC.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The choice is finally almost up. I have until Saturday to make 12 choices for my registration.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In order of &#8220;merit&#8221;:-</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>VJC - Science</p><p class="break">Temasek - Science</p><p class="whiteline">ACJC - Science</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>ACS(I) IBDP would unlikely be one of my choices. Comment if there are any opinions.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Btw, Death Cab for Cutie makes pleasant music.</p></p>
