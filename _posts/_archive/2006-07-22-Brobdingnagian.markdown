<p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this letter that was shown to me:-</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="whiteline">Letter writer used too many big words - 14th July, 2006
</p><p class="break">The letter, &#8220;Use of Singlish/Chinglish will impede communication with the world&#8221; (ST Online Forum, July 12), by Dudley Au contains no fewer than nine big words, and for good measure, a Latin phrase.</p><p class="whiteline">One such word, feracity, is not found in reputable dictionaries like The American Heritage, Collins Unabridged and the single-volume Oxford English Dictionary. The word abundance could have replaced this rare word.
</p><p class="whiteline">Big words distract the reader when simpler ones will do. Uncommon words do have their usefulness; they draw attention or imply a subtlety. This forum could do with more common words.
</p><p class="break">Mark Lee Marn Fatt</p></blockquote><p>

Imagine unreasonable customers demanding to see your manager whenever your facial muscles needed some rest. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Exceptions as always, exist.</p>
