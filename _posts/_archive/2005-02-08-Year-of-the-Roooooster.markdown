<p class="whiteline"><p>The only thing that&#8217;s worth mentioning is that I&#8217;ve built a &#8220;new&#8221; computer for myself over the CNY eve. Nothing spectacular - yet.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, here are the system specs:-</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>AMD Althlon XP 2200+</p><p class="break">Asus a7v8x mobo with gigabit, SATA, FireWire...</p><p class="break">Kingston DDR-SDRAM 512mb CLK 3.0</p><p class="break">GeCube ATi Radeon 9200SE</p><p class="break">Linksys Wireless-G PCI</p><p class="break">Some cheap casing + PSU</p><p class="break">Cheap CDROM drive</p><p class="whiteline">IBM Deskstar 14GB Harddisk</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, harddisk space isn&#8217;t important for this system as all files are stored on my server, which has like 400GB of space, via (W)LAN.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What&#8217;s lacking currently is it&#8217;s own Monitor... I&#8217;m wishing for a Samsung 17" LCD panel. Preferably wall-mountable.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Next would be a Graphics card upgrade and a 200GB harddisk to install Games on. Soon, it&#8217;ll be Lan-Party ready... by year end I hope?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As for the OS... hehe. Of course, but this time, it&#8217;s <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.gentoo.org/']);"  href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>. I&#8217;ve found a really good Home Media Centre System, Freevo. It&#8217;s lighter than MythTV and can do what MythTV cannot do. I.e. Catalogue all media and present a nice interface for selection and play.</p>
