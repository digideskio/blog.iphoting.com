<p class="whiteline"><p>All praise be to God.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Went off for InnovateIT this morning with only two half-days of preparation (out of the given 7) and was still hacking the powerpoint together right before the preliminary round presentation. Having little to no presentation preparation and/or rehearsal, we went in with the aid of a timer available in the presenter&#8217;s view.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That aside, thinking that we&#8217;ll hardly be able to make it to the finals given the amount of effort we placed in, we just played Bridge during the lunch time, right before the preliminary results announcement.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Half-way through the Bridge game with another guy from NJC (as out team consists of 3 people only), we were told that we got into the finals. &#8220;Oops,&#8221; we had to stop the game, get out laptops out and start fixing some issues and implementing suggestions given by the judges.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>We&#8217;re ushered into the auditorium, to be ready for presentations in 20 minutes, during which, we hastily generated a few more screenshots for the mock up. Amusingly, due to the way we randomly chose to sit in the second row, we were team 5 to present, allowing a more time to rush. We went up when it&#8217;s our turn and gave it the best shot we could, impromptu.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Prizes available were the Macbook, O2 XDA, and the iPod Touch. Personally, I was eying the touch as it&#8217;s a product which I didn&#8217;t already have, but would like to own one.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>At the result ceremony, we&#8217;re glad to be recognised for the team which &#8216;put in the most effort&#8217; into our presentation, much to our extremely wide cynical grins.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Moments later, we&#8217;re declared champions of the competition and walked away with new Macbooks each.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Hallelujah! Amen.</p></p>
