<p class="whiteline"><p>These days, my national slavery commitments have been keeping me away from the computer and phone most of the time, leaving me little opportunity to comment about eye-brow raising &#8216;news&#8217; that keeps popping up over the past week.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In fact, a thought even transpired in my mind â€“ newspapers are withheld from NSFs so that they will not be disillusioned by the absurdity of current affairs and dilute their determination to &#8216;protect Singapore; WITH MY LIFE&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>To further prove my point, check out this <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/lee-kuan-yew-if-bloggers-who-defame-me.html']);"  href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/lee-kuan-yew-if-bloggers-who-defame-me.html">blog post</a> and compare it to what the Shit Times have been feeding us over the past week and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.todayonline.com/articles/256190.asp']);"  href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/256190.asp">see</a> <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.todayonline.com/articles/256189.asp']);"  href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/256189.asp">for</a> yourself what perspectives mean.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That aside, my already blunt mind have been irritated by the strange flow of illogical arguments and justifications seen in the news about <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.todayonline.com/articles/255964.asp']);"  href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/255964.asp">ISD &#8220;punishments&#8221;</a>. The irony is that the justification is delivered by the Home Affairs Minister, whom in my opinion, ought to be sacked.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Aright, that&#8217;s about it for this weekend.</p></p>
