<p class="whiteline"><p>In the training school I was previously in, I disagreed with many of their training principles and ideals. The primary ones which drew great ire from me was their concept of &#8216;leadership&#8217;, &#8216;supervision&#8217;, and &#8216;command and control&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8217;Leadership&#8217; in their warped perspectives indicates the ability of one to force actions down people&#8217;s throats with speed and little dissent. Such definitions would certain lead to massive resignations (commonly seen in a place I once knew) and staff dissatisfaction. Not to mention, poor motivation and negative repercussions when &#8216;initiative&#8217; is required are troubling side-effects. In fact, by reality&#8217;s definition, this form of leadership is a massive failure and will probably not work at all in an open environment where people are not bound to work by a bond or law.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Leadership in this world has got more to do with earning respect than demanding respect. Ways to earn respect which I have seen is to have great moral fibre and graciousness, especially the ability to admit to mistakes and accept criticisms. Just saying sorry when you&#8217;re obviously wrong and treating everyone with respect, even with simple words like &#8216;please&#8217; and &#8216;thank you&#8217;, will make a big difference to your standing as a &#8216;leader&#8217;. It goes without saying, ability and knowledge of the subject-matter at hand needs to be of very high standards.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The following annoying definitions that I&#8217;ve been forced to contend with is with the phrase, &#8216;supervision&#8217; and &#8216;command and control&#8217;. Their concept of supervision is that it doesn&#8217;t exist if no one is shouting or just making (stupid) noises. I mean, when dealing with people with the ability to think, constant noise pollution and/or verbal harassment will not increase their working speed, and might on the other hand be counter-productive.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I believe the most important aspect of supervision is communicating your requirements <em>clearly</em> and succinctly, with reasonable deadlines, so that people can work on them without confusion and misunderstandings (and thus less shouting and directing noises need to be made by you). Equally important is to give people sufficient freedom to achieve your requirements. Allow them to use their methods (which are usually more efficient than yours); show them yours only when you see that they are going the wrong way (but without force).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, these methods will definitely not work in times of war but the art of leadership is to adopt the relevant style in the appropriate context. Go ahead and shout when you can&#8217;t be heard; similarly, speak nicely when you are within hearing distance.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>At that, I still stand by my decision to avoid hiring (if I get to) anyone who has served in the armed forces as a regular, with the exception of pilots.</p></p>
