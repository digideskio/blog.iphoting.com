<p class="whiteline"><p>Today&#8217;s really slack and acTV managed to produce a decent live broadcast over to the other side amid much frustration and complications, no thanks to the cooperation or lack thereof to certain members of the media resource team. Moreover, I got really pissed with this particular guy from MR; I&#8217;m not referring to you if you&#8217;re in year 5, 3, 2 or 1, but a certain person from year 4. Incompetence has never reached higher levels than this.</p>
