<p class="whiteline"><p>The Mac works as advertised. Podcasting works out of the box really well; can&#8217;t imagine PCs creating podcasts in the same amount of time used. Garageband comes with various useful pre-recorded loops available for use too. Imagine using <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/audacity.sf.net/']);"  href="http://audacity.sf.net/">Audacity</a> for this; I can&#8217;t.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I tried Call of Duty 2 and it ran quite well, albeit with missing frills in the graphics department. At least, as a Universal Binary, it runs with native goodness. This should dispel the notion that Macs cannot play games! <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> At this rate, I might be tempted to go purchase more game titles from <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.aspyr.com/']);"  href="http://www.aspyr.com/">Aspyr</a>; their collection of great games are huge, and for Mac too.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now that Apple has acknowledged the discolouration problem with white Macbooks, there&#8217;s still one more thing that they need to acknowledge - Heat due to fans being too slack. I&#8217;ve now delegated all music playing duties to my iPod, in attempts to reduce CPU usage, reducing the amounts of heat produced. At times, the amount of heat produced can easily increase the ambient temperature of my room by a few degrees. I&#8217;ll need to find a way to pipe the heat out of my room without the use of an air conditioner.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Also, check out <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html']);"  href="http://wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica</a>, a really cool application for mathematics portfolio and the like.</p></p>
