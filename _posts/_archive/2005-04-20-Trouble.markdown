<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t look for trouble, trouble finds me&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My sanity has almost been drained out of me. A bullet, high speed and low visibility; once you&#8217;ve seen it, it&#8217;s too late.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Ask me not what happened, for you will know in due time.</p></p>
