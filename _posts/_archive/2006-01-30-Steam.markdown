<p class="whiteline"><p>Went to Pariss to have a wonderful dinner buffet. The food is great; most of the stuff available for consumption is tasty. However, the cutlery was dirty. They ought to have done a second pass to the washing of these plates.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Blogging at such an hour really kills all thoughts that I have. I&#8217;ll aim to write more decent blog posts. Anyway, tomorrow is the eve of homework day and more money.</p>
