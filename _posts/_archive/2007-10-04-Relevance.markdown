<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m happy. I thank God for such results that were good, given the amount and quality of preparations I placed into these examinations. Even more so, I&#8217;m extremely glad for my grade 7 (out of 8 people in the level) in Business and Management which I thought was a goner given the marking conditions the paper was set in.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Still, the road is up ahead; now is the time, for us, to shine. Shine with the face, of Christ divine – It&#8217;s lyrics from a great song, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.delirious.org.uk/lyrics/songs/nowisthe.html']);"  href="http://www.delirious.org.uk/lyrics/songs/nowisthe.html">Now Is The Time</a>, by <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.delirious.org.uk/index.html']);"  href="http://www.delirious.org.uk/index.html">Delirious?</a>.</p><p class="whiteline"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EPFB8auxm_w"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EPFB8auxm_w" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whenever people start attacking the relevance of church to culture of the world, I always ask <em>the</em> simple question, &#8220;what is Christianity for, yourself or others?&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Like it or not, the correct answer (according to the Bible), is others. The church exists to serve the needs of the non-believers, to put it simply. That is the premise for all &#8216;relevance&#8217; the church needs to be, i.e. as relevant as it can be, so as to serve the needs of non-believers. The needs of the believers then follows.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Firstly, what needs? Find a hurt and heal it, find a need and meet it, that kind of needs. The best example of what to do can be found in the gospels where Jesus went around to the prostitutes and the unclean people to heal them, get to know them, and to simply love them (more than just showing love). He never complained or stayed away from them because they were &#8216;worldly&#8217;, or that they are too poor or sinful. Equally so for us, we need to go out into the place of commerce, culture, the marketplace to continue this modern-day ministry of love. How would the ministry even work if it&#8217;s totally irrelevant to the current culture of the marketplace?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, how relevant and to what extent? Daniel shows us a very good example in the Book of Daniel. Daniel (Belteshazzar), Hananiah (Shadrach), Mishael (Meshach), Azariah (Abednego), accepted King Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s orders to learn the cultures, language, sciences, literature of Babylon (Dan 1:20), short of consuming the King&#8217;s food (Dan 1:4-8). The children of Judah even accepted Babylonian names of gods of that society upon them (Dan 1:7), but importantly, they stopped short of Babylonian food. Food in this case refers to the values of the society which they refuse to subscribe or ascribe to (Dan 1:15). Still, they were educated Daniel even became ruler over whole province of Babylon and chief administrator over all the wise men (including magicians and astrologers) of Babylon (Dan 2:48).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That, in today&#8217;s terms could mean the CEO of the MTV business, having control of culture and media establishments of the marketplace, rich, famous and powerful, but yet subscribing to a strong and sound Christ-like value system. Ironically, if this were to happen in today&#8217;s times, any believer or church worker holding that position would surely face intense criticism from both believers and non-believers alike. I would love to hear how they criticise the children of Judah.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As briefly as I possibly can, I hopefully managed to explain why church needs to be relevant to the marketplace it is in.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s pretty sad and annoying when people go around talking down to others saying that they are definitely wrong and whatever, especially with people who are gay and what not. Love, not judge; love, not hate; love, not condemn. Leave the condemnation to God, the final arbitrator.</p>
