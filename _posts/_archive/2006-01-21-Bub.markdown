</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;Smart people speak from experience; smarter people from experience don&#8217;t speak&#8221;. How true, but it feels somewhat anti-social. Makes me wonder what casual conversations are for when they mean and worth nothing. Maybe the construction of friendships.</p>
