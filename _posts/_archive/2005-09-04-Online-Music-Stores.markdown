<p class="whiteline"><p>According to online music stores, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.eff.org/IP/DRM/guide/']);"  href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/guide/">the customer is always wrong</a>.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">Many digital music services employ digital rights management (DRM) — also known as &#8220;copy protection&#8221; — that prevents you from doing things like using the portable player of your choice or creating remixes. Forget about breaking the DRM to make traditional uses like CD burning and so forth. Breaking the DRM or distributing the tools to break DRM may expose you to liability under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) even if you&#8217;re not making any illegal uses.</p></blockquote><p>
