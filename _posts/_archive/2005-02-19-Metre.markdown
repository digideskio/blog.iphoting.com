<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve learnt that the definition of a metre is relative to the speed of light. So.... If the speed of light were to change, the length of the metre would in fact change. The faster the speed of light, the longer the metre; the slower the speed of light, the shorter the metre.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Just in case you&#8217;re wonder which metre I&#8217;m talking about, it is the 100cm metre.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Magnetism is related to electricity and is also related to light!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Wow. Now, I&#8217;m starting to understand calculus and it&#8217;s use. But looking at the A. Maths textbook, I&#8217;m still having difficulty in relating multiple &#8220;objects&#8221; to each other. I can&#8217;t imagine how it&#8217;ll be like when more &#8220;advanced&#8221; topics are touched...</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I just hope that A. Maths is not dependent on a teacher to get A1s.</p></p>
