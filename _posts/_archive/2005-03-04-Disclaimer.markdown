For my personal safety, on and off line, I hereby decide to sticky this post so that all those who ought to have read this would be able to read it without *much* difficulty.

Here, I&#8217;m going to state a disclaimer for those who do not already get it.

Blog n. :-

> a personal chronological log of thoughts published on a Web page

Yes. Right, note the word personal and the word thought.

Now, if you still have not gotten the hint, I shall restate it for the benefit of those who are ignorant of what a blog is.

Firstly, whatever that is written here, on or off this domain, by me, are solely of my personal opinion and does not represent any institution, organisation, corporation, business or any other independent individuals. Furthermore, my opinions are not meant to be libellous in nature and should not be assumed so.

Secondly, by reading this content on this site, the reader agrees to disclaim the author of all liability arising from dissatisfaction, unhappiness, busting-of-ego or whatever physical or mental loss or damage can be incurred by the reader as a result of reading this site.

Thirdly, the author of this site neither endorses nor takes responsibility for any information or opinion expressed in anyway by any third party in any comments, trackbacks or links which are external to this website.

Fourthly, the reader agrees to be open-minded and not take any of my opinions as libellous in nature. The reader also agrees that my opinions need not be accurate nor factual and that my thoughts can be wild and irrelevant.

Finally, SHOULD THE READER NOT AGREE TO THE PROVISIONS STATED HERE AND OR ABOVE, OR ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SITE, AND OR THE CONTENT, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SITE IMMEDIATELY.

Note: Should the reader decide to include this disclaimer onto his/her site, the author shall not be held responsible in any way should this disclaimer fail to disclaim the reader in court or where ever intended. In other words, usage of the disclaimer above is entirely AT YOUR OWN RISK and I am not a lawyer in case you are wondering.

Note 2: This disclaimer is written solely by myself and not lifted from anywhere, with the exception of the last clause (in caps) where it was adapted.
