<p class="whiteline"><p>Somebody asked why I believe in God, and Jesus specifically; I&#8217;ll give a long answer below.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve dabbled with <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheism</a> a good third of my life and have never found the quality of joy and the quantity of miracles &#8216;reason&#8217; can provide.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Seriously, how cool it is when I&#8217;m going to be late due to traffic jams, to be able to pray for morning assembly to be delayed for few minutes, just so that I can make it in time, or sometimes for it to rain such that there will be no assembly and thus no bookings? Reason will tell you that it isn&#8217;t possible; but with God, nothing is impossible. Personally, it has occurred every single time. Coincidence? Nah, if it happens whenever prayer is involved, I&#8217;ll call it a God-incidence.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For a moment of time, I tried all that I could to believe that God didn&#8217;t exist, but I didn&#8217;t manage. God through all his creation and wisdom, never failed to drop hints or to remind me of His omnipresent existence.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Surely, the ability to reason, or reason itself must have come from somewhere, greater and more encompassing that itself – &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; (Jn 1:1), where &#8216;word&#8217; in this context refers to the Greek <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos">logos</a>. But then, maybe this can be true?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>But what about other Gods?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, I&#8217;ve also looked at other religions but none has so far to my knowledge, declared as clearly as Jesus have, &#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me&#8221; (Jn 14:6).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Ok. So Jesus declares that He is the way to God himself and itself. But then, how can I know that everything in the Bible is true?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then Jesus declares, &#8220;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away&#8221; (Ma 24:35), which means that the Bible is true and will come to pass. <sup>[1]</sup></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If Bible is true, Jesus is the way to the Father, and logos comes from God, YWHW is the only God almighty, is so, then, it would require only either of the four previous axioms to be disproved for this whole premise to collapse.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, to disprove any of these axioms, reason is surely not the way to do it. Neither should reason be the way to prove any of these axioms to be true as reason, as written, came from God.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This leads to a horrible circular argument which got me no where, but two decisions still need to be made. God exists? and which?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In my quest to answer the first question and to make the first decision, I came upon what is known to be <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager">Pascal&#8217;s Wager</a>. Pascal &#8220;posits that it is a better &#8216;bet&#8217; to believe that God exists than not to believe, because the expected value of believing (which Pascal assessed as infinite) is always greater than the expected value of not believing&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This is why I decided to bother going through this troublesome motion to wonder if God exists. In the Pascal&#8217;s Wager chain of thought, it will be beneficial to believe that God exists, or at least investigate this question, which I&#8217;ve done.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If God(s) exist, then, which one is <em>the</em> God?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8217;Logically&#8217;, if God is to be God, He has to be the one and only God. How can God be under another God and still have sovereignty as God? Thus, God must be <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism">monotheistic</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, if God is God, I assume that He must be omnipresent. So, how do I find Him?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, if He is omnipresent, speaking, or praying to Him should get the message across instantly. So I prayed (without saying it aloud so that nobody can hear and affect the outcome), &#8220;God, whoever you are, you should hear this and lead me to yourself. I want an experience and a real encounter with you&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Henceforth, a series of &#8216;divine&#8217; encounters with various people, events, and situations that finally brought me to where I am; a covenant with God that I be rooted in this church, nevertheless the situation, and that I will have an experience and journey of a lifetime. The very reason I&#8217;m convinced about Jesus because He rose from the dead and conquered the impossible; who else managed to do just that as prophesied?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>After all, the very reasons I dabbled in atheism and other things was that I didn&#8217;t go through this thought process and that I haven&#8217;t managed an exciting and eventful personal relationship with God, even though I started off as a Christian.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thus far, this Church has finally shown me the impossible. Faith in reality, miracles in quantities, generosity in actions, passion for God like none other, and most importantly, revealed God Himself through the trinity in reality and not just theory. The Power of the Word alive is something I can never forget and as the Psalmist says, &#8220;One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple&#8221; (Ps 27:4).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In this extremely brief recollection on hindsight, I have left out many points which I thought was hard to explain and require immense elaboration which space here does not permit. As such, feel free to chat with me with any questions you might have and I&#8217;ll try my best to answer.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In a nutshell, if you haven&#8217;t considered these questions on or about God, do take some time to give it some thought before it is too late; from what I have learnt, God respects free will greatly – even the decision in rejecting him.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thus, before you quickly reject him, let me conclude by linking <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.greatcom.org/laws/english/flash/']);"  href="http://www.greatcom.org/laws/english/flash/">The Four Spiritual Laws</a> and if you reject, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/The%20Consequences%20of%20Rejecting%20God.htm']);"  href="http://www.reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/The%20Consequences%20of%20Rejecting%20God.htm">The Consequences of Rejecting Jesus Christ</a> if you choose to believe, is linked for completeness.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>With that, I pray that your decision(s) that you have made, previously or now, will be something that brings no regret. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
