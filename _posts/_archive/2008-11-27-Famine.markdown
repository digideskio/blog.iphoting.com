<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;<sup>19</sup>He shall deliver you in six <em>troubles</em>, yes, in seven, no evil shall touch you. <sup>20</sup>In <em>famine</em> He shall redeem you from death, and in <em>war</em> from the power of the sword. <sup>21</sup>You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and you shall not be afraid of the <em>destruction</em> when it comes. <strong><sup>22</sup>You shall laugh at <em>destruction</em> and <em>famine</em></strong>, And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.&#8221; (Job 5:19-22).</p>
