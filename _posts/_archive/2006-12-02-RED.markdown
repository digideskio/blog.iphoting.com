<p class="whiteline"><p>Today is World AIDS Day. <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/joinred.com/']);"  href="http://joinred.com/">(RED)</a> is making a difference. Need an iPod Nano? Why not get a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/ipodnano/red/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/red/">RED</a> one? Buying a (RED) product will let a (RED) company donate a portion of the profits to purchase and distribute anti-retroviral drugs to people who need it. Sent an email asking why it isn&#8217;t available in the Singapore online Apple Store.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, is also SAT I examination day, followed by a tight schedule with cell and church service, all thanks to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.singaporemarathon.com/']);"  href="http://www.singaporemarathon.com/">Standard Chartered Marathon</a> tomorrow which I&#8217;ve decided to help out.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, there are these things called, EE, ToK, Business IA, World Lit, which are like laughing at me from the back of my head. Not funny. Not funny at all.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A couple of days ago, I found myself at lunch with a group of amazing friends, once-in-a-lifetime kind of friends which I&#8217;m eternally grateful for. It eventually came to the topic - Future. What would it be like 10 years down? How would Singapore turn out 10 years later? Has Singapore developed way too fast for its people, the educational system and possibly the government to catch up? Has Singapore become dysfunctional due to its very own success? Are the lies spun by the politicians actually for our own good? Is the 146th really objective to keep the society stable? What exactly is the result of the &#8216;tyranny of the masses&#8217; effect? Is democracy the only way out? What exactly do the pieces of paper we call money actually represent? Those hours were well spent regardless of the output.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>It&#8217;s getting common that I see beautiful halos on magnificent cloud formations. I just saw another one a few days ago.</p></p>
