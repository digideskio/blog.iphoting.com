<p class="whiteline"><p>More things done in less time? I agree to a large extent.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I believe that everyone has a &#8220;task-scheduler&#8221; with varying strengths. Some are more capable whereas others could juggle more tasks within a short time frame.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, whether multi-tasking is a productive lifestyle really lies in the eyes of the beholder. Older generations seem to have a larger hate for it whereas the youth love it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, it&#8217;ll not be efficient when your mind is unable to keep track of parallel activities and waste too much time, upon resumption of activity, tracing back to where one last left off.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On the other hand, this helps train mental derivial skills and flash/temporary memory. Short-term memory would also be more capable and would be able to partition itself based on current activities and/or thoughts.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, since sub-conscious actions, i.e. heart beating, occur parallel to our conscious actions, i.e. reading, without much difficulty, then I have reason to believe that parallel conscious activities <em>should</em> be possible with or without some practice.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Am I making sense?</p></p>
