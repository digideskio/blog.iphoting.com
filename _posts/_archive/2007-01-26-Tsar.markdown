<p class="whiteline"><p>Today marks the last day of the tsar of it. We wish him all the best. After all, leaving for the greener pastures is always a better choice than bending back and compromising on one&#8217;s principles. When morality is at stake, flee, or one might become one of them before long.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My class has slowly transitioned from Floating Bridge to Contract Bridge whenever time permits. Contract Bridge games require a tad more brain power and time, but it doubly more interesting, exciting and satisfying.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Looking back, I haven&#8217;t learned how to play the guitar properly, but the first step would be to get one for myself this birthday.</p></p>
