<p class="whiteline"><p>We had thermometric titration. The hard part about it is the presence of powerful air-conditioners which never fail to disrupt one&#8217;s results (temperature readings).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As for the qualitative analysis, the tests are &#8220;never-seen-before&#8221;, producing all sorts of gases, such as ammonia and carbon dioxide (which many fail to detect, including me). Lots of decoys within the tests. For those whose forte isn&#8217;t chemistry, it can be considered difficult. The two ions are Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The zinc was really hard to detect. We&#8217;d to heat a &#8220;blue and wet&#8221; solid in a strong flame. With that 5mm x 5mm substance, it&#8217;s really hard to see once all the water has been evaporated. Only with well-trained eyes and patience, one can then notice that the solid turns yellow when hot and white when cool.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>It was fun anyway.</p></p>
