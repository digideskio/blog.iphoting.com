<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m back from the stinking, dirty, foggy, disgusting, yet more technologically advanced city (when compared to Singapore) of Shanghai. Everything, almost everything, is more advanced, with the exception of the people there. From the traffic lights to night lights; broadband speeds to traffic speeds, all faster and mightier than Singapore.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That should explain why everyhub is failing, badly.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With reality washed up my face and mountains of work awaiting, I&#8217;m in for a ride, especially when all the opposition rallies are on this week, together with deadlines.</p></p>
