<p class="whiteline"><p>This week is hectic. Results from competitions, start and the continuation of my prelims, Teachers&#8217; Day and last week of Term.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh. Happy Teachers&#8217; Day for those of you (who are reading) who happen to be teachers.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, members of our class, were like digging teachers and giving them presents that we&#8217;d spent quite alot of time (and money) on. Flowers, broaches, teddy bears and dogs, shirts and <em>toys</em>!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>3 hands full of people turned up today. What a <i>great</i> way to celebrate teachers&#8217; day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The days are getting dreadful, especially leaving the school. Fond memories, untied loose ends and dear friends. All that&#8217;s worth many lifetimes, to be let go, without a choice.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>True purpose of existance or living must be redefined.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A new month is here. 3 more to go, a new year will take over. A fresh beginning, less backlog of trash, easier to manoeuvre.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh yeah. Podcasts are cool.</p></p>
