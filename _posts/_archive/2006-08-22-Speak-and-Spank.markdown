<p class="whiteline"><p><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">Reality distortion field</a> experienced its finest demonstration this day during the ToK lecture and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.lyricsdomain.com/2/billy_joel/']);"  href="http://www.lyricsdomain.com/2/billy_joel/">Billy Joel</a> was compared to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handel']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handel">Handel</a>. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> It much summarises how I&#8217;d felt about English Literature taught and assessed in school.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It&#8217;s quite amazing that the Singapore Police let <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/singaporerebel.blogspot.com/']);"  href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/">Martyn See</a> off, for producing Singapore Rebel (a &#8220;political&#8221; film), with just a stern warning; no jail, no expulsions, no caning, nor any suspensions. Of course, fighting is a bad thing no matter how it is placed. Thankfully, the Singapore Police knew better to let him off than to punish him for making some trivial video.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then it got me wondering. If a manager were to fire and change his secretaries frequently, is there a problem with the secretaries or does the problem actually lie with the manager himself; neither or both?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>There&#8217;s this funny piece of assignment called portfolio which I think is a test of skills different from what&#8217;s intended. It assumes that the student know what he or she should <em>not</em> have already known and what he or she should already know. I also find it quite amusing that it took me a day or so to acquire and learn how to use the tools of the trade. Lessons or guided explorations to these tools would also be a great help. Maybe in future, they should make life a little easier by stating the &#8220;skill prerequisite&#8221; and &#8220;what you should learn from this investigation&#8221;. Removing the guesswork would allow us not-so-telepathic students the ability to produce more logically flowing &#8220;investigations&#8221;. And they were saying that it takes more than 3 full non-schooling days to complete this portfolio. Now, I guess that I am to assume that time would wait for me.</p></p>
