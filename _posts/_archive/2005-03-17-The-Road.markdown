<p class="whiteline"><p>The path which many had walked, many too had swayed. Some chose to leave, others got misled, many lost their way. This path looks calm, peaceful and bright. However, hidden along the hidden elements are obstacles which harm and backstab one.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Truth gets distorted and the &#8220;popular&#8221; truth spreads. The vehicle, constantly looked at, quoted and misquoted, would soon break down due to the weight and burden.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There are those who drive to get to destinations and there are also those who drive to parade what they have. For the latter, by-standers might get offended. What they see need not be what they should see; what they think need not be what the driver wants them to think.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Offended, they needed a place to scream. A place to vent off their fustration. They can choose to vandalise the offensive vehicle personally or get someone else to do it. Vandalism is illegal in Singapore. The by-stander then would rarely have such a freedom or privilege. Feeling desperate, they attack the driver, spread gossip, defame him. Just to vent their anger on a misinterpretation or narrow-mindedness.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;ve realised why cars in Singapore rarely lasts for more than 5 years before they are retired.</p></p>
