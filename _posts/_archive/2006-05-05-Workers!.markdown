<p class="whiteline"><p>Apparently, the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2006/5/5/1934204.html']);"  href="http://singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2006/5/5/1934204.html">PM got his press secretary to apologise on his behalf</a> for a part of what he&#8217;d said, &#8220;Right now we have Low Thia Khiang, Chiam See Tong, Steve Chia. We can deal with them. Suppose you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members in Parliament. Instead of spending my time thinking what is the right policy for Singapore, I&#8217;m going to spend all my time thinking what&#8217;s the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters votes, how can I solve this week&#8217;s problem and forget about next year&#8217;s challenges?&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Very sincere eh?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Anyway, I&#8217;ll be off to the WP rally at Serangoon Stadium. I&#8217;ll post pictures if I manage to get some.</p></p>
