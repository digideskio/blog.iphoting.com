<p class="whiteline"><div class="serendipity_imageComment_center" style="width: 640px"><div class="serendipity_imageComment_img"><img width='640' height='480' border='0' hspace='5' src='http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/uploads/Life/Cold_Storage-Eggs-2.jpg' alt='' /></div><div class="serendipity_imageComment_txt">At Cold Storage</div></div>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Nope, I didn&#8217;t do that. The mess was there for like a whole half an hour in Cold Storage (yesterday) before I&#8217;d left. I seriously hope that the eggs have nothing to do with my exam results.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today&#8217;s Physics papers were of unprecedented difficulty. I wasn&#8217;t surprised as I&#8217;d guessed it from the ridiculously easy paper 3. To me, the papers weren&#8217;t that difficult but to many others that I&#8217;d observed in the examination hall, it&#8217;s a nightmare. Sights of people looking resigned and sighing were more than common. I too had a few eye pops.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I can&#8217;t seem to understand some questions at first instance. The language seems so ungrammatical and it took me a few re-reads and eye strains before I got its intended question. It&#8217;s either my English is really screwed, the paper&#8217;s English is really screwed or both. I believe the latter.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The Geography Paper 2 however, is slightly easier. The demands now shifted to diagrams to illustrate answers, it&#8217;s much easier to explain that way. Half of my pen&#8217;s ink was used up to fill 11 sides of writing paper with words and at least 5 diagrams, within 135 minutes.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>E. Maths Paper 2 tomorrow, I&#8217;m mentally prepared for a killer paper. Don&#8217;t expect to live henceforth.</p>
