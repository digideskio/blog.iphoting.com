<p class="whiteline"><p>My silence lately has been due to an overdose of &#8216;freetime&#8217; and sleep. There are a few things that I would like to say.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Firstly, I&#8217;m glad that the volume of homework has died down and that there&#8217;s more time available for me to sleep.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Secondly, adventure told me something that&#8217;s really amusing. He told me about the redefined the definition of &#8216;donation&#8217; and &#8216;voluntary&#8217;. Conventionally, &#8216;donation&#8217; is said to be &#8220;a voluntary gift (as of money or service or ideas) made to some worthwhile cause&#8221;, but according to him, it is a &#8220;recommended monetary contribution to a &#8216;worthy&#8217; cause with a <em>minimum limit</em>&#8221;. How amusing that times have certainly moved ahead of most reputable dictionaries. What&#8217;s more, most teachers swear by it, including English ones! A certainly great way to keep ahead of times. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Thirdly, there&#8217;s this game <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.bridgebuilder-game.com/bb-info.php']);"  href="http://www.bridgebuilder-game.com/bb-info.php">Bridge Builder</a> which captured my attention for quite some amounts of time.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With that, I leave you with a nice quote, &#8220;Smart people speak from experience, smarter people from experience, don&#8217;t speak&#8221;.</p></p>
