<p class="whiteline"><p>I don&#8217;t understand. I visit Yoshinoya occasionally for food but almost 90% of the time, the counter staff have a condescending attitude. I find it extremely annoying. If this happens again, I&#8217;m going to write complain letters for the good of our society. A gracious society so they say, where they can&#8217;t even treat locals properly.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Google has released <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.google.com/talk/']);"  href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>, an IM service for <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/gmail.google.com/']);"  href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> users based on the XMPP Protocal (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.jabber.org/']);"  href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>) where other 3rd party IM clients, like <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/gaim.sourceforge.net']);"  href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net">Gaim</a>, could connect with it for regular chats. Great! Finally, there&#8217;s a viable alternative to that stinking nasty and overly bloated MSN Messenger. At least, with Google, I&#8217;m more or less assured about its uptime and system stability. Maintanence times would also be inexistance and thus there would be relatively less &#8220;lost productivity&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Now now guys, those of you with Gmail accounts, better get onto this XMPP system. I&#8217;ve got fed-up and tired and fustrated and angry enough with MSN Messenger Network, something different would be good for my health and <em>yours</em> too.</p></p>
