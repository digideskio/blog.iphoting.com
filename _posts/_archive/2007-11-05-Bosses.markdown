<p class="break"><p>I remember fondly four years ago, I held an interesting proposal meant to revolutionise student interaction within school via electronic means. It was meant to be proposed but I gave up after being blocked left, right, and centre, countless of times. People who insists on the status-quo can be credited for causing dysfunctional and ineffective processes. This Dilbert comic that I just saw speaks exactly of it.</p><p class="break"><!-- s9ymdb:81 --><img width='750' height='544' src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/uploads/Life/Dilbert-Hier.jpg" alt="" /></p><p class="whiteline">Scott Adams really lives in corporate offices. Seriously, if Dilbert comics depict situations that are almost exactly to real-life situations, it&#8217;s time to change a job, or stop working for somebody altogether.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Meanwhile, if you&#8217;re bored, check out an interesting documentary, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.stealthisfilm.com/']);"  href="http://www.stealthisfilm.com/">Steal This Film</a>. It speaks volumes about the culture here.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Ah yes, one more thing â€“ released a new draft; get it from the same place.</p></p>
