<p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s one thing that as a perfectionist that I hate, is that I tend to pick out defects more than things well done, failing to acknowledge quality work well done, albeit the minor flaws. However, to overlook minor details is a bad thing™ nevertheless.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>That aside, I&#8217;m rather disappointed by the fact that the font face used for text on the façade of the administration block is inconsistent from the one used at the spaceframe. Worst, the font face for &#8216;(Independent)&#8217; isn&#8217;t even unified across buildings; they are completely different. Just compare them with block A, space frame and the Recreational Centre, and you&#8217;ll see what I mean.</p></p>
