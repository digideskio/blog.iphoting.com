<p class="whiteline"><p>Here I am, rushing through Chinese homework, half of my mind wondering when on earth the next 2 episodes of Initial D 4th Stage would be released, and reading about how people once-loved-but-now-hate blogging.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Seriously, those of you who just start a blog and throw it away cuz you&#8217;ve lost interest in it... <em>hai</em>. Abused the whole meaning of blogging anyway. IMHO, blogging should be a way that one volunteerily air&#8217;s one&#8217;s thoughts, so as to off load secondary inspiration elsewhere, preventing them from &#8220;short-circuiting&#8221; with one&#8217;s primary thoughts. Also, one has only to gain from the 3rd party perspective, revealing holes which one would not normally see in 1st person perspective.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Therefore, in combination with one&#8217;s concious and sub-concious mind, one could easily solve most problems which are within one&#8217;s understanding and wisdom. Like what the Oracle said, to see past the choice, one must first <em>understand</em> it.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Understanding is thus a very fundemental and important aspect of living. Master the method to understand in order to understand. So as to lead one to a more advanced perspective of matter before his vision.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>When one understands what is before one, it places him through the matter, like a surgon&#8217;s disection of a subject. Once that subject has been disected, it can now be &#8220;officially&#8221; classified as &#8220;known&#8221; as in knowledge, i.e. another piece of wisdom; another piece of knowledge. Which, most importantly, helps one through whatever needs he may, or by any chance would, have needed.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Knowing more is better than knowing less. In the first place, knowing that you know too little is the first step in the direction of wisdom. Thinking that you already knew, however, is usually the direction <em>away</em> from wisdom.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, in life, one <em>should</em> always seek and learn, however only from the source that holds <em>truth</em>. The degree of truth to accept would usually be left as an exercise for the learner.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In this way, blogging would teach one about oneself. Others from others&#8217;. Or maybe, a guage on the path of your travel. Too left or too right? The narrow and difficult or the wide and popular?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What&#8217;s your <em>final</em> <i>destination</i>?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Woah... What a long and totally unrelated to the lateral meaning of the title for this entry.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Looks like it&#8217;s the flu and the exhausion.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>School&#8217;s to start tomorrow. I&#8217;ll enjoy it, I guess...</p></p>
