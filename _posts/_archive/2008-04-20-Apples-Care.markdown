<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve learn a few things about AppleCare and how it basically works in the whole AASP ecosystem. A few weeks ago, I sent both of my Macbooks in for repair for various issues, ranging from bluetooth malfunction to bloated batteries.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A mistake I&#8217;d made was that I failed to contact AppleCare before I sent my machine down for repairs.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>According to the AASP, the replacement of my bloated battery has to depend on Apple&#8217;s approval and there&#8217;s no guarantee that the (optional) replacement is free of charge. Exactly as they say, they messaged me a few days later claiming that Apple has refused to replace the battery and that I can purchase a new one for S$208. Based on my past experiences with AppleCare, I knew this isn&#8217;t usual and I thus declined to pay for any replacement, leaving the battery at that while I find time to contact AppleCare.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Yesterday, I finally managed to contact AppleCare and indicated the issue of a bloated battery. Upon confirmation that the battery is operationally fine but bloated, the support representative offered to replace my battery without much hesitation.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well and good. Then, I checked my repair logs of the machine and realised that it has exceeded the magic number of 3. Gladly, I prompted the agent to check what was changed in the machine when I last sent my machine for repairs and he too noted the repair count and informed me about the replacement policy.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well and even better. I got a new case number and am to call AppleCare again during their Australian office hours so that I can get this expedited through their customer relations department. That lies the royal trouble. I&#8217;ve got no time to call AppleCare between Monday to Friday, 9 am to 3 pm.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I guess, there&#8217;s no harm waiting as new revisions of Macbook would be released real soon. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The bottom line is this: Always call AppleCare first for any hardware related issues before bringing it down for repairs for a greater and less frustrating experience.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Come to think of it, I don&#8217;t mind getting replacements yearly now that Time Machine is working so well. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
