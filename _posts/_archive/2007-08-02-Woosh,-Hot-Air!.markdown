<p class="whiteline"><p>My backlog of blog posts is building but I shall start clearing them, one by one. Without further ado, I shall begin!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I have this interesting thought experiment again. Let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s this &#8216;quality of teaching&#8217; survey that all students of a particular class are to take. Questions within the questionnaire pertains to the teacher and the way lessons are delivered and/or conducted.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What would go on in your mind if the teacher comes up to the class and brags about his long list of  &#8216;achievements&#8217; and &#8216;awards&#8217;, and how one should not &#8216;play a fool&#8217; with the survey and be serious with it, just a week before it is due to be taken.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I sat there wondering. After all, knowing the mindset of our age, reverse-psychology is the in thing. I mean, when you tell someone who hasn&#8217;t touched the stove when it&#8217;s hot to not touch it, there&#8217;s a very high chance that that will be the first thing he has on his mind to do.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, there&#8217;s this thing called Charity Cafe where proceeds are to go directly to the &#8216;Student Welfare Fund&#8217;. I&#8217;m always wondering what this fund is and how it is used and managed. A savings account would be appalling. My class had a rather brilliant idea â€“ low effort, decent returns for charity cafe. With the minimal amount of exertion of effort, we are able to clock in a handsome amount of profit.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today, the prefectorial board came along and attempted to market their exorbitant jackets. After being ripped off by the $75 compulsory bomber jacket for all former occasions, I&#8217;m now weary of anything the administration declares, including any compulsory tickets or socks. Here&#8217;s a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/theoneandonlyuncleedna.blogspot.com/2007/08/now-this.html']);"  href="http://theoneandonlyuncleedna.blogspot.com/2007/08/now-this.html">good entry</a> for the jacket design competition.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Given that this is the IOC examination session, I see inflated absenteeism rates, which I believe is a positive sign. It shows that &#8216;lessons&#8217; in school is totally irrelevant to the quality of achievement by the students, secondly, it also show that students are keen on getting  good grades. Even Mr Wang, a very esteemed blogger, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/mrwangsaysso.blogspot.com/2007/07/joys-of-skipping-school.html']);"  href="http://mrwangsaysso.blogspot.com/2007/07/joys-of-skipping-school.html">is a proud supporter of this movement</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of course, I&#8217;ve truthfully reflected the sensitivity of the administration towards feedback by students in the MoE survey. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>FoP is here again this weekend, it&#8217;ll be great I hope.</p>
