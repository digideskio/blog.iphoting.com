<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" style='color:black; font-size: 14pt;'>

Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what&#8217;s to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You&#8217;ve had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You&#8217;ve been through most of the ups and downs of life already. Now you get to sit back and relax.
