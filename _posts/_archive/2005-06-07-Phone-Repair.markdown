<p class="whiteline"><p>This morning, I saw that my phone has <em>lost</em> its reception <em>again</em>. Apparently, the fix yesterday didn&#8217;t work. So, went down to the service center <em>again</em> with my mother this time.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Was the second person in queue there and soon enough, the customer service officer did regret her job. She was &#8220;shocked&#8221; and in fear and didn&#8217;t say much. She swapped place with another officer, which I think is of a higher rank.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The way this officer (she) handled my mother is worth commending. She didn&#8217;t blow up and still maintained her smile, almost throughout our stay.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>After explaining our plight, she accepted my mother&#8217;s demand for a new phone as a replacement. She told us to come back at 1pm, it was 11am then. That&#8217;s it. My mother blew up. 3 hours is too long to replace a phone. Still, the officer offered to call the moment it was ready.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, the phone was ready at 11.45am and I collected it from the counter.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I sincerely hope that the phone won&#8217;t screw up again or this company is seriously screwed.</p></p>
