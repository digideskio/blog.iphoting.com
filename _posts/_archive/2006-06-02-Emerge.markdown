<p class="whiteline"><p>The Emerge conference is wonderful.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, I&#8217;m glad that a new version of Thunderbird is finally released, as a universal binary, allowing me to ditch Mail.app completely, as Mail.app&#8217;s IMAP implementation is buggy and slow.</p>

I&#8217;m quite impressed by the methods used by the management to get their workers to comply. I&#8217;m not sure how true this is.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I need more time.</p></p>
