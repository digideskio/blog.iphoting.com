People never fail to amaze me. What&#8217;s amazing to me is that <!--<a href="http://thelittlebigboy.blogspot.com/2006/07/fark.html">this person</a>--> there&#8217;s a person who is extremely displeased with the additional time given for studying due to the World Cup match where exams are to be delayed by a day.

The Police can&#8217;t take that as an illegal gathering as after all, it really isn&#8217;t a gathering.
