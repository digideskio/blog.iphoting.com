<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m finally back from civilisation and reintergrated into civilisation, or the lack thereof. For a better picture of how the camp went, refer to these posts, written by <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/plainofvisions.blogspot.com/2005/11/take-two.html']);"  href="http://plainofvisions.blogspot.com/2005/11/take-two.html">Toitle</a> and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/plainofvisions.blogspot.com/2005/11/agglomeration.html']);"  href="http://plainofvisions.blogspot.com/2005/11/agglomeration.html">Nova</a>. They paint a much nicer impression than I can with my terrible command of English.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In short, I slept for 6 hours over 3 days and 2 nights, killing time over meaningless DotA sessions and the various varients of Warcraft 3 multiplayer games. The file <i>exchange</i> and interaction sessions were worthy though. After the break of camp, played a few games of bridge. Possibily due to my lack of sleep (tired eyes only), I wasn&#8217;t very friendly throughout the game. My sincere apologies for that. But surprisingly, we see bids of 5 and 6 in the games, even with such sleep deprivation.</p>
