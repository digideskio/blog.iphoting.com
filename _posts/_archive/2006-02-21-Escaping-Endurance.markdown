<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve learnt a few things today.</p>
</p><ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t kill live frogs.</li>
<li>Always name people by their handles online.</li>
<li>Sleep when there&#8217;s time.</li>
<li>Be mentally prepared for any shocking pieces of work that might fall from you-know-where.</li>
<li>LifeHouse makes nice music.</li>
<li><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.pandora.com/']);"  href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> has a rather not-so-nice licensing agreement with the record companies.</li>
<li>B &amp; M Tests can be both easy and hard, depending on how shocked one is. I didn&#8217;t find it hard though.</li>
<li>Scouts day tomorrow, which means that there&#8217;s something different for chapel.</li>
<li>Physics test was postponed due to Founder&#8217;s Day rehersal.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve got to have a topic for a speech ready by tomorrow, and in <em>Chinese</em>, and it&#8217;ll be graded.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve need to make up my mind on the EE topic that I&#8217;m to embark on by this week.</li>
<li>The <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.colorquiz.com/']);"  href="http://www.colorquiz.com/">Colour Quiz</a> is quite accurate.</li>
</ol><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The book, 1984, has large number of familiar areas where we can draw parallels within life.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>P &amp; C for maths is made more difficult when the &#8216;model&#8217; answers provided for each question need not be the right one.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I wanted to talk about computing but the number of difficult-to-translate-into-chinese words are quite daunting. Maybe I should talk about the dangerous of copyright and software patents. Or maybe something about the &#8216;elections&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>&#8217;Newspeak&#8217; would remove the need for Literature. How straight.</p></p>
