<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, after checking my Hotmail account, I&#8217;ve finally decided to give Friendster another try. My first try hadn&#8217;t been too pleasing as there were <em>hardly</em> anyone then. This time, it&#8217;s all but little. The membership base is huge and the speed is ridiculously slow.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, I see many old and new friends there and added them. The daunting task is to write testimonials, which I&#8217;ve got to admit is quite beyond me.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s a good tool to waste time on and is useful for socialogy analysis. It&#8217;ll be even better if they&#8217;ll offer friendship tree or graphs to see how everyone is connected. Well, this would be a challenge for their database servers.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Anyway, have a nice weekend ahead.</p></p>
