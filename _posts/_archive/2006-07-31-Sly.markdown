<p class="whiteline"><p>Today&#8217;s speaker for Chapel is quite a funny person, but there is one thing that he&#8217;d said that I found it very enlightening, not that his jokes or other points are dumbing.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>He claims that according to scientific research, though citations were not given, people are usually unlikely to accept, respond or act upon negative feedback and tend to ignore them. This made perfect sense! It would be pointless sending any form of feedback that is negative as according to the speaker, they would be discarded as unconstructive criticism or simply <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29">spam</a> (Shit Posing As Mail). This finally explains why talking to the wall is more productive as you get to hear yourself speak from the echo due to the wall than compared to sending feedback.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>These days, whenever I walk past the piano which stands proudly and solemnly in the middle of the dining room, I never fail to turn my head and take a glance; the always beautiful instrument, now left in silence and peace, I long one day to play on it as I&#8217;d always done when time was in such abundance.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The next time I get such a chance, I&#8217;ll play FairyTale (童话).</p>
