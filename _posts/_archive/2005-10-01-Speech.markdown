<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m waiting for the day when/where:-</p>
</p><ul>
<li>blogging is banned</li>
<li>a permit is required for setting up a blog</li>
<li>every blog post needs to be approved/moderated by MICA</li>
<li>greater freedom of speech in China (PRC) than in Singapore</li>
<li>a truly one party state</li>
<li>people getting sued over any tiny thing they say which is not wrong but not provable in court (thanks to defamation act)</li>
<li>the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.bannedinsingapore.com/list.htm']);"  href="http://www.bannedinsingapore.com/list.htm">banned in singapore</a> movie list exceed that of in very very conservative countries. Makes you wonder why people download movies instead.</li>
<li>one has to pay a per-play fee to listen to any music, regardless of how much one has paid for the track of music</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I didn&#8217;t know that there were any form of workers&#8217; union in its intended form in singapore.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Damn.. I still don&#8217;t understand. How can anyone live with 2mb of mailbox space these days. Sending a few photos to people results in bounces due to mailbox full problems. Please, stay away from MSN/Hotmail, they are evil. Hop onto <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/mail.yahoo.com/']);"  href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Mail</a> or <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.gmail.com/']);"  href="http://www.gmail.com/">gmail</a> (get invites from me) instead.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Somehow, I&#8217;ve stopped hating Blink 182. Must be due to some metal that I&#8217;ve heard in one of their albums which put me off.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Still, apparently from the articles in the papers, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that a majority of average-joes have inaccurate ideas of what blogs are and that a flash presentation is <em>not</em> a power point presentation.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve also learn (from those who live in wells) that most people don&#8217;t understand the concept of blogging. Many think that it&#8217;s just rubbish (I don&#8217;t agree at all) and time wastage (which I don&#8217;t entirely disagree), but blogging is definitely not something that only people with no life do.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I guess, the concept of citizen journalism is not grasped properly, yet. Don&#8217;t trust the news papers on politics and on blogs.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>After today&#8217;s Chinese tuition, I&#8217;ve learnt that in &#24544;&#21512;&#22635;&#31354; (zhong1 he2 tian2 kong4), the chances of getting a selection right are higher when I use my initial choice. Any subsequent changes usually will result in an incorrect answer. If worse come to worst, count the number of strokes. The selection with the greatest number of strokes is usually the correct answer. Dumb isn&#8217;t it?</p></p>
