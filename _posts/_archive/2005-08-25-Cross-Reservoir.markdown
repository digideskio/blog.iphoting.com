<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I realised that a large majority of my classmates, like me, placed greater emphasis on their studies than turning up at MacRitichie to feed mosquitos and take up valuable oxygen.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>First things first, before you start proclaiming that I&#8217;m disloyal, et cetra, I must emphasize that my prelims would begin in 4 days time. Doing badly in prelims and such would be a greater disservice to the school and myself than not turning up to take up space.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, don&#8217;t you dare say that prelims are not important. It&#8217;s not like this school would even consider accepting me (if I ever want to allow them in the first place) as a post secondary student without decent results in prelims. If such happens, I&#8217;ll might consider allowing you to say that prelims aren&#8217;t important. But as of now, no way.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Full-fledged Geography today. The facts had better not be a Teachers&#8217; Day present.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I think I&#8217;m starting to get the thing that old people get, where they become more forgetful and slow in response. Working with red-tape sure speeds up the aging process. Never underestimate inefficiency.</p></p>
