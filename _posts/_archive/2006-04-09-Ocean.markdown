<p class="whiteline"><p>Cinamon and I were at Cold Storage one day, looking for some unique and hard to find food. Somehow, we came to the area where packaged fish is being sold. Then, there&#8217;s this sales lady who came up to us and said, &#8220;these fish came from the ocean&#8221;. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/eek.png" alt=":-O" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I was for a moment, stunned by such a unconventional fact delivery style, and hence due to a slip of mouth and not-a-good-thing wittiness, I responded casually with, &#8220;they usually do&#8221;. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> She disappeared after that.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I wouldn&#8217;t say what I did was right, but it was really funny at that moment. Yes, I do know that fish can come from drains, river and tanks, other than the ocean. She could have said that these are salt water fish and I would be less tickled. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Next up would be an IOP topic that I really need to learn how to come up with, together with an EE proposal which I have got no idea what format is demanded. I&#8217;ll think about it later then.</p></p>
