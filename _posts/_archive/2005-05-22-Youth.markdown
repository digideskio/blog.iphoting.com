<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m slowly slipping into denial. Time is moving <i>fast</i>, bringing nobody along. The further down the road I look, the less colourful I can think or see.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Choices loom ahead. <em>No</em> turning back. The ominous weather, delivery of darkness, help little.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Voices say, choice not easy; not smooth. Not the best when in consideration. But regret it not after. Make best of what&#8217;s here now, as what lies ahead will not be the same.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>They say &#8220;ignorance is a bliss&#8221;; happiness drained away with knowledge. The vigour to live fades with increasing wisdom. The sagacious live for their main purpose, others enjoy the very diminished that they have. Enjoy <i>every</i> moment; there will never be one that&#8217;s the <i>same</i>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Above all the forboding events which rush to reveal themselves, solace can be sought from the peace that can never be found.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There no longer lies a trodden path. The wild awaits. Be cynical. Be skeptical. Carefree lives will be gone.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And thus, a time pause, or reversal would bring happiness, or would it not?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>How nice it would be to become young again?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The days where you don&#8217;t have to think ahead and that <em>someone</em> would tie up the loose ends that you&#8217;ve made. Demanding choices require not your attention and life is a breeze.</p></p>
