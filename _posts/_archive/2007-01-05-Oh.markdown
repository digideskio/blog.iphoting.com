<p class="whiteline"><p>Within a flash, thankfully a non-blinding one, the first week of school is over. Many sights fail to escape my sight and some, highly amusing. Let me bring up a few observations.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Over the past 3 days, whenever I go down to the SAC for recess, the air conditioning in the regular area has always been off, leaving the new &#8216;Student Plaza&#8217; area air conditioning to cool down the whole area. For that, I have to take my hat off to the administrators for creative yet legal methods in cutting costs. I&#8217;m guessing that the electrical bills for the newly constructed areas are borne by the contractor(s) as the buildings have yet to be fully handed over. Cleverly, as such, the SAC can be cooled effectively, free of charge.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, there&#8217;s this COG (Career, Opportunities and Guidance) Department with only an advertised Deputy Director. Under Director, it reads &#8216;-&#8217;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I can&#8217;t wait for the new <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.switchfoot.com/']);"  href="http://www.switchfoot.com/">Switchfoot</a> album, Oh Gravity.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Haha... and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.delirious.co.uk/']);"  href="http://www.delirious.co.uk/">Delirious?</a> is <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.delirious.co.uk/tournews.html']);"  href="http://www.delirious.co.uk/tournews.html">back</a> the week after next. Another cool statistic, 5,100 respondents to altar calls over the Christmas weekend.</p></p>
