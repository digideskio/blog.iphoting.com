<p class="whiteline"><p>This is the DAY.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, apart from the iPod Nano, my cousin gave me a cool book. He&#8217;s the rebellious do the different way kind of person. <em>The God Delusion</em> by Richard Dawkins. I do have a slight interest in the opposite school of thought, i.e. atheism, however. So I guess, this book will be a nice read.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Was at IKEA Tampines just now and was amazed by the number of people who are there. In a remote corner of Singapore, there was a massive traffic jam along the road leading to and from Courts and IKEA. Surprisingly, most of them left IKEA and/or Courts with their hands filled with some form of purchases.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Surely not everyone there is looking for new furniture, I hope. Cheap hot-dogs maybe.</p></p>
