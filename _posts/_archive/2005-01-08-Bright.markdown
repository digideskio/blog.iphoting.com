<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I had 2 tuitions. Namely, English and Chinese.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I had quite a fun time during English Tuition... In fact, I don&#8217;t call it tuition at all :p.. It&#8217;s more like a chit-chat stress-relief session. We did some funny things like laugh at the teacher&#8217;s senile-ness (she started laughing first), and talking about all sorts of pronounciation stuff about English.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For example, Produce is both a verb and a noun. However, pronounciation/stress is different for them. This&#8217;s what Singaporean English lack.... Who cares? I don&#8217;t see many who know the diff in stress...</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As for Chinese Tuition, it&#8217;s more like a social gathering, where we catch up with current &#8220;affairs&#8221; and jokes. The thing is that conversations are mainly in Chinese, much to my displeasure <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />... At least, I can understand and am understood.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s one thing that I didn&#8217;t enjoy today was missing both the Bus and MRT. I don&#8217;t mind if I&#8217;ve missed it by a minute or so, but this time, for both bus and train, I&#8217;d missed it by a few seconds. Thanks to heavy traffic which prevented me from crossing the road and, inconsiderate people on the esclator who don&#8217;t seem to want to clear the way.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Wasted like 10 minutes waiting... Which could be better spent on my dinner...</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Speaking of homework, there&#8217;s plenty but I don&#8217;t feel like doing until the last minute. My reason for that is that it lacked &#8220;stress&#8221; or &#8220;excitment&#8221;. For my case, rushing E. Maths at top speed at like 10pm is really more fun then that of on a hot Saturday Afternoon with more than enough time...</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Hmm... Let me see... I have A. Maths, E. Maths, Chemistry, H. Chinese and History homework which are to be <em>due</em> on Monday. Hehe ... There&#8217;s always time before the start of school.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, I played a little more Need for Speed: Underground 2 today and found that the Toyota AE86 is the most agile car that I&#8217;ve experienced. Street X, Mountain Passes and URLs, all are easily passed, without the Turbo installed.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>So, moral of the story is to just get an AE86 with all the upgrades minus the Turbo and you&#8217;re set to win anything, everything. Of course, a certain degree of skill is recomended.</p></p>
