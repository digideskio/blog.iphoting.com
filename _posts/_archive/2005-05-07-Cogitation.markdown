<p class="whiteline"><p>A new word that I&#8217;ve learnt through my stroll of blogs that I do occassionally. The depth and light- heartness of some, light my day and brings me joy and ideas to think and feed my mind.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The stale atmosphere clouds my mind. The mess which even this pensieve cannot bear. The chaos that the cyclones can&#8217;t rival.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I need to reorganise and re-partition my mind.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Sometimes, I don&#8217;t know how to think.</p></p>
