<p class="whiteline"><p>A shocking revelation decended today. The well-known FAG (Flim Actors&#8217; Guide) was officially denounced before the year 5s by the CCA master. What an amazing sight to behold. I always thought that CCAs which conflicted each other was bad and now that it&#8217;s being cleared up, it&#8217;ll be even better. So, I&#8217;ve learnt that fag is not a CCA, nor an interest group and as such, membership or participation in anyway can hardly be condoned by the school for school related stuff. What surprises me more was that the CCA master requested for those interested in joining fag to disregard their sales pitch and just join mpac instead. Wow, world peace <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
