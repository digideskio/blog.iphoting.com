<p class="whiteline"><p>The first official school day with official lessons started today. Lessons went generally ok but I&#8217;ve learnt that my ability to do public speaking in <em>Chinese</em> has sort of disappeared from me. My stuttering lately has also become more annoying for me. It&#8217;s like I know what to say just that the words need time to form through my mouth.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Maybe I should just talk more.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My Chinese teacher seems really experienced as he can tell one&#8217;s personality based on handwriting and chinese name.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And the school website has been defaced once again by some unknown and unseen figures. It&#8217;s so annoying.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Free signups are terrible too, check <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.bugmenot.com/']);"  href="http://www.bugmenot.com/">this</a> out.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1471']);"  href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1471">&#8220;Apple&#8217;s Jobs says Michael Dell should eat his own words&#8221;</a> sounds really hilarious.</p></p>
