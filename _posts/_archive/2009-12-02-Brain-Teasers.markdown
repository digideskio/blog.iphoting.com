<p class="whiteline"><p>One of my friends suggested I check out this interesting site, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/projecteuler.net/']);"  href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, to keep my brain teased and concurrently challenged in coding up solutions. It is somewhat similar to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/codegolf.com/']);"  href="http://codegolf.com/">CodeGolf</a> but different.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>What Project Euler aims to do is to maintain a repository of member-contributed mathematical problems in ascending order of difficulty. A problem is considered solved when you submit a correct answer into the answer text box. Upon completion of a problem, you gain access to problem notes (if available, written by the author) and a special forum thread which discusses or exhibits solutions to the problem.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The fun part is that syntax and schematics of how you arrive at the answer doesn&#8217;t matter. You can cheat all you want but it defeats the purpose of even solving the problemâ€”you&#8217;ll be better off doing penmanship. What&#8217;s different about Project Euler is that you can use any method, software, or language to arrive at the answer; the degree of difficulty completely lies in your hands. You can choose to come up with clean algorithms, copy algorithms off the net, or recursively brute-force your way through, Project Euler doesn&#8217;t care. As long as you submit a correct answer, the treasure box opens and you get to see different perspectives to solving that particular problem.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The best part of solving a problem is to see geniuses coming up with artistically sparse, concise and elegant solutions in a language of their choice. Trying to understand what goes on in that few lines of powerful code really challenges and changes your ability to think.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With 266 problems (as of this writing) waiting for you to chew, you&#8217;ll have no shortage of brain exercises, providing you with ample fun for your otherwise idling time, perfectly suitable for boring meetings too! <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
