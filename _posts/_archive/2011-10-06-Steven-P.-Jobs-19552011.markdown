<p>Today, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/stevejobs/']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">Steve Jobs left us</a>. No words can be used to describe what he has done, or who he is, but one thing for sure, we can see his touch in the technology we use every day.</p>

<p>He has propelled humanity forward, made things that were once inaccessible, accessible to everyone. He has raised the bar of possibility, turning hyperbole into reality.</p>

<p>His passion for his vision brought him where few have gone. He has proven to us that passion trumps rationality. To live the life that your heart leads you, he did exactly that—nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>As an inspiration to many of us, let&#8217;s not forget, this man changed the world—we should too, in our own ways.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s raise our glasses:<br /></p>
