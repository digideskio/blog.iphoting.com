<p class="whiteline"><p>nova-ex brought this interesting <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2007/02/28/why_cant_programmers_program.html']);"  href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2007/02/28/why_cant_programmers_program.html">post</a> about &#8216;programmers who cannot programme (code)&#8217;. From the first comment immediately proceeding the post, here&#8217;s an abstract.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break"> The best predictor of failure was an MSc in Comp Sci. One candidate in particular just sat there declaring variables, line after line, until I took away his piece of paper.</p><p class="break">The successful candidate, who did it in about 20 minutes, had no Comp Sci qualifications... although he did have a degree in Philosophy.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Within the article, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/tickletux.wordpress.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/']);"  href="http://tickletux.wordpress.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">FizzBuzz coding test</a> was mentioned and I promptly gave it a <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/golf.shinh.org/p.rb?FizzBuzz']);"  href="http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?FizzBuzz">shot</a>. Little did I know, I got <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/golf.shinh.org/p.rb?FizzBuzz#PHP']);"  href="http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?FizzBuzz#PHP">&#8220;ranked&#8221;</a> 50th position in PHP submissions, even with such spacious, liberal, and clear coding.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That led to two cool brain tickling sites, namely <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/golf.shinh.org/']);"  href="http://golf.shinh.org/">anarchy golf</a> and <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/codegolf.com/']);"  href="http://codegolf.com/">Code Golf</a>. The former is an informal place to test coding in over 46 languages, while the latter is a serious competition with rankings with 4 major P + R languages, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>On the other hand, Hao pointed me to <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest">IOCCC</a>, a very amusing competition, with [a] winner[s] from Singapore.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Looking at it, Computer Science is not my cup of tea at all, seriously. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I&#8217;m inclined to think that <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> scientists are very likely to have great empathy. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
