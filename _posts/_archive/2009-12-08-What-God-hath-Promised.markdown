<blockquote><p class="break">God has not promised</p><p class="break">Skies always blue,</p><p class="break">Flower-strewn pathways</p><p class="break">All our lives throâ€™;</p><p class="break">God has not promised</p><p class="break">Sun without rain,</p><p class="break">Joy without sorrow,</p><p class="whiteline">Peace without pain.
</p><p class="break">God has not promised</p><p class="break">We shall not know</p><p class="break">Toil and temptation,</p><p class="break">Trouble and woe;</p><p class="break">He has not told us</p><p class="break">We shall not bear</p><p class="break">Many a burden,</p><p class="whiteline">Many a care.
</p><p class="break">But God has promised</p><p class="break">Strength for the day,</p><p class="break">Rest for the laborer,</p><p class="break">Light for the way,</p><p class="break">Grace for the trials,</p><p class="break">Help from above,</p><p class="break">Unfailing sympathy,</p><p class="whiteline">Undying love.
</p><p class="break"><small>(Annie Johnson Flint)</small></p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="break"><p>God is always faithful, regardless of our faith. God is always listening, whether we talk to Him or not. Most importantly, God&#8217;s grace is always sufficient for us.</p></p>
