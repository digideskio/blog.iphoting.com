<p class="whiteline"><p>&#8217;I Not Stupid Too&#8217; is a movie which I&#8217;m surprised that it dared to be an &#8216;anticipated&#8217; sequel to &#8216;I Not Stupid&#8217;. Notwithstanding the (poor) plot, I&#8217;m too surprised that this passed the MDA tests for &#8216;decent use of language&#8217;. I guess, there are only a few reasons why people want to watch this movie.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>One, they want to support local mediacorps(e) productions. Two, they got conned by the movie poster. Three, the want to watch the (cute) actors. Four, they needed cheap yet expensive entertainment. Five, they have watched every other movie and needed to complete their record for this Chinese New Year. Six, maybe something else...</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, 2.5 upon 5. It didn&#8217;t fail as the actors looked decent; plot wise, it&#8217;s too generic and predictable.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Played rounds of majong today. Didn&#8217;t win much at all.</p></p>
