<p class="whiteline"><p>Well, that&#8217;s it, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.delirious.co.uk/']);"  href="http://www.delirious.co.uk/">Delirious?</a> just had their <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.delirious.co.uk/html/news/20091204/285/delirious-night-on-god-tv-your-chance-to-vote.html']);"  href="http://www.delirious.co.uk/html/news/20091204/285/delirious-night-on-god-tv-your-chance-to-vote.html">last performance</a>, a swan song of sorts. Of all music bands, christian music in particular, they hold a special place in my heart. They were the first band that introduced me to the rock genre of gospel music, with world famous tunes like, &#8220;Did you feel the mountains trembleâ€¦&#8221;, &#8220;Majesty&#8221;, &#8220;The Happy Song&#8221;, &#8220;History Maker&#8221;, &#8220;Rain Down&#8221;, and &#8220;I could sing of your love forever&#8221;, with Smith Martin&#8217;s distinctive and one-of-a-kind voice.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>They had their last gig in London, United Kingdom. Though I wasn&#8217;t able to make it for that one, but I was glad that I&#8217;ve gone for at least 3 of their previous live performances.</p>
