<p class="whiteline"><p>I suspect that the telephone exchange that my house phones are connected to got fried by the rain, or something to that effect. The house is no longer receiving external dial-ins while dial-outs work fine. Whenever someone calls, they will hear a ring or two and lots of static, similar to what you see in horror movies.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Apart from this, my internet connection has become intermittent. The problem is that the repair man would only be here tomorrow morning.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I hope my modem holds up to this as I don&#8217;t have a surge protector for telephone lines.</p></p>
