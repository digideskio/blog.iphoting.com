<p class="whiteline"><p>Came back from the SDA rally near my house. It was overwhelmingly filled with people. The messages presented were highly interesting. I bought a book, A Compilation of Speeches &amp; Questions, by Steve Chia. Within it, I don&#8217;t believe that the opposition has not provided alternative view points nor alternative methods of doing things. For those of you who are planning to blindly support the ruling party, I suggest reading <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/commentarysingapore.blogspot.com/2006/04/send-our-old-folks-away-to-bintan.html']);"  href="http://commentarysingapore.blogspot.com/2006/04/send-our-old-folks-away-to-bintan.html">this article</a> by Mr Wang about senior citizens&#8217; future. I hope your conscience is not pricking you. Then, check out <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/commentarysingapore.blogspot.com/2006/04/adventures-of-james-gomez.html']);"  href="http://commentarysingapore.blogspot.com/2006/04/adventures-of-james-gomez.html">another write-up</a> about James Gomez.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>For some key points in one of the WP rally, you might want to take a look at <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/04/dont-attend-wp-rallies.html']);"  href="http://happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/04/dont-attend-wp-rallies.html">Lucky Singaporean&#8217;s post</a>; it makes a highly amusing read.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If you need some ideas of what constitutes defamatory by the rulers, check out this <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2006/4/25/1910237.html']);"  href="http://singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2006/4/25/1910237.html">article</a>. First World Governments using Third World methodology to silence opposition?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Tonight&#8217;s news has been highly biased. The air time given to the ruling party is highly disproportionate, while the opposition has not been given sufficient and respectable coverage. First World media we have eh?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>My del.icio.us roll and Starred Goggle Reader items contain interesting and thought provoking articles which I spy while doing my daily surf through the web. Do check them out if you want some fresh perspectives on things around us.</p></p>
