</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I feel. The human mind is easily decieved by just supplying information repeatedly and repeatedly, as if truth. Believing no longer involves the &#8220;distance&#8221; between two points nor &#8220;signt/sound&#8221; any more. It&#8217;s much simpler than that.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The lack of methods of verify sources would tend to allow a person to gradually accept as truth as there isn&#8217;t anything which would put that source as non-truth.</p>

</p><p class="break"><p>Is no longer a Sci-Fi story where brain waves are needed. It&#8217;s now, perception.</p></p>
