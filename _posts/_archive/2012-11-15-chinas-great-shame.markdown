Yang Jisheng writing for the [NYTimes][source] Opinion:

> Thirty-six million people in China, including my uncle, who raised me like a father, starved to death between 1958 and 1962, during the man-made calamity known as the Great Famine.
> …
> The toll was more than twice the number of fallen in World War I, and about six times the number of Ukrainians starved by Stalin in 1932-33 or the number of Jews murdered by Hitler during World War II.

There's a tendency for the PRC to denounce foreign aggression and claim that the PRC people are suppressed. But think about it, who are the biggest suppressors of the PRC people?

> After 50 years, the famine still cannot be freely discussed in the place where it happened.
> …
> Communist leaders established a vast system of slavery in the name of liberating mankind. It was promoted as the “road to paradise,” but in fact it was a road to perdition.

Simply disgusting. The [Nanjing Massacre][1] pales in comparison to this.
