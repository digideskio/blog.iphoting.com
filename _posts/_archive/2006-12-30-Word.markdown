<p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this verse that I come across that is simple, but it does have many levels to it. That is, John 1:1.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The amount of data loss during translation is really insurmountable. &#8216;Word&#8217; as above in Greek is actually &#8216;logos&#8217;. The difference in the English and Greek meanings are left as an exercise for the reader, though close yet different.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this saying, simple sentences can hold simple and/or complex ideas; yet complex sentences can only usually hold complex ideas. Using complex sentences to means simple things would make things unnecessarily complex, rendering the whole issue, complex.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Whatever.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m halfway through Richard Dawkins <em>The God Delusion</em> but I&#8217;m still not an atheist. There&#8217;s a loophole in this arguments here and there. I need more time to accurately put my finger to them.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Meanwhile, school work is bugging me to no end.</p></p>
