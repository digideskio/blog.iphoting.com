<p class="whiteline"><p>In the Garden of Eden, Genesis 2:16-17, &#8220;And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That was the sermon of last Sunday. I thought I&#8217;ll highlight some of the points mentioned about the outrageous events occurring around the world.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Firstly, I don&#8217;t think the movie, Da Vinci Code, should be banned of censored, though I admit having not watched that said-to-be-poor production.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Secondly, in the words of my pastor, innocence is not virtue. And I have to agree. Having everything cleaned and censored out would certainly weaken our resistance to temptation; this applies to everything subjective too. Hence, virtue would actually be tested innocence; the ability to turn down temptations and move away from it, thus demonstrating true maturity.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In the first place, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was something that&#8217;s highly dangerous, and yet it was planted in the centre of the garden. Not the at side, underground or elsewhere, but centre. To protect Adam and Eve, God could have easily removed or killed the tree, but there must be a reason why God didn&#8217;t chop the tree down. Does that me we should go around cutting down every tree which has leaves of interesting colours or has some wild dreams that many know that it&#8217;s just a dream?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Finally, I don&#8217;t see the point of using cannons in killing flies. A simple press statement with sufficient backing should do; no need to go all out and protest and complain, or worst, disrupt screenings, as if the sky has fallen.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Concept applies to Harry Potter, drums, electric guitars, (church) organs, prosperity, happiness and keeping up with (reasonable and safe) trends.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>In other non-eventful news, I&#8217;ve placed an order for the 13.3" 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo White <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html']);"  href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">Macbook</a>; estimated delivered-by date is set at 1st June 2006. The Singapore Customs can do with a little more speed.</p></p>
