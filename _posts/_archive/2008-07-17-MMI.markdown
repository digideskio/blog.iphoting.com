<p class="whiteline"><p>Having gone to a Cardiologist in <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.de-referer.com/?http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/backissues_aug04_01.htm']);"  href="http://www.de-referer.com/?http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/backissues_aug04_01.htm">MMI</a> a week ago, and being told that there&#8217;s nothing he could do, I decided to consult a respiratory specialist myself, rather than being referred left, right, centre and wasting weeks long of time to waiting.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Given that I didn&#8217;t write anything about my experience at the MMI, I will do so here before I forget.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>MMI is a sub-unit of the SAF HQ Medical Corp, operated in the typical bureaucratic fashion. Obvious signs that indicate a military establishment is the ban on camera mobile phones, requirements on entry passes, uniformed personnel, extreme inefficiency, and man-power imbalance.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The reason I&#8217;d OOC&#8217;ed was due to chest pains, coupled with Asthma, and the MO decided that I needed rest and referral to the cardiologist as he apparently heard irregular click-murmurs in my heartbeat. Fast forward 4 weeks from that day, I took a morning &#8216;off&#8217; and went, hopefully solving this annoying chest pain mystery.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The first diagnostic test they did, without even seeing the specialist, was the standard resting <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiogram']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiogram">ECG</a>. I do not comprehend their obsession with this selective diagnostic tool as I&#8217;ve done it at least 5 times with the same results – normal. What I really need is an <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiogram']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiogram">echocardiogram</a> which uses ultrasound to create an image of the heart. When I finally got to see a certain Dr F, he did a quick listen to my heart and proclaimed, &#8220;I don&#8217;t hear anything abnormal, go&#8221;. I then asked him about my asthma if it could be the cause of pain and he promptly directed it to another department which I had to make another referral from my MO. At that, I was made to leave and was discharged immediately. This is similar to the classic case of <em>confirmation bias</em>: &#8216;evidence of no problem", with added incompetence and disregard of the patient and his referring doctor.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Being really annoyed, I decided to just make a respiratory specialist appointment at Raffles Hospital where by the waiting time would be under a week and I get things done properly, the non-SAF way.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Fast forward a few days and I got posted to another unit, leaving me with no chance to talk to my MO about the blotched referral. Fast forward a few more days and I&#8217;m given &#8216;off&#8217; to visit the hospital.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The first thing I didn&#8217;t do was an ECG. In fact, I didn&#8217;t even do any ECG throughout the whole course of the diagnosis. Through a stethoscope, the respiratory specialist could hear what my MO heard – irregular click murmurs. He then sent me for X-ray, and the all-important echocardiogram, which diagnosed the cause of my chest pains – <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_prolapse']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_prolapse">MVP</a>. He later commented that he was very surprised that the cardiologist at MMI failed to hear the murmurs and left it at that.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Case-closed. Lesson learnt: Never trust the SAF in anything, especially your health and lives.</p></p>
