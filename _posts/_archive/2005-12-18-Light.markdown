<p class="whiteline"><p>Had a candlelight service today. Unique experience and damn that I didn&#8217;t bring a camera along (my phone is with the repair shop too). Send me the photos guys!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And I&#8217;ve learnt something new about graduation rites; don&#8217;t know how to describe though.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m very very amazed by how petty people can become. Angry and pissed over the smallest of all things, creating a stand-off. Negative.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>My chain of thought always gets broken whenever I start typing a blog post. Sorry for the stale entries.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>After reading a few chapters of the textbooks, I finally feel that the difficulty has finally arrived. I&#8217;ve been waiting 10 years for this moment. It&#8217;d better be worth the wait.</p></p>
