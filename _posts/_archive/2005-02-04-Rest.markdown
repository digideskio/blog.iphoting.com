<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m finally got the time to blog... I&#8217;m feeling sicky here and decided to skip a day of school to slow my pace down... I really needed sleep and peace.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve no idea what I&#8217;m infected with... The symptoms don&#8217;t seem to be influenza but it&#8217;s more severe than a common cold... Sinuses?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, school has not been good for me and has barely started. The fact that I&#8217;m so worn out is a cause for concern.. I can&#8217;t imagine the days/weeks leading up to the major exams.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;ve nothing to say. Life&#8217;s getting boring.</p></p>
