<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, I overheard a conversation between a science teacher and students.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The students were questioning the teacher on why the remedial dates keep changing. The teacher responded, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to have remedial, but it is that I got scolded by people for having remedial during departmental meeting days&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That response was amusing.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Either the teacher was lying or that meetings come before students&#8217; academic performance. I wonder. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Now, I&#8217;m to go full speed ahead for my EE and ToK OP as I&#8217;ve got my ToK 2nd Draft done. I just thought the DP4&#8217;s response to the deadline query, absolutely hilarious. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
