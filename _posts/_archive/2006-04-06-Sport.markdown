<p class="whiteline"><p>This morning, I was at the library and wanted to read up on a few sport articles for my own research. Upon reaching the newspaper stand, at 8am, only the main section of the Straits Times were available. The Home section containing the Sport section was absent for its usual housing area.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Moments later, I finally got hold of the Home section of the paper and, to my horror, I found that the whole Sport section of the paper was missing! The whole few pages of text is missing. Someone, at such earliness, had removed or stolen that part. That doesn&#8217;t very much make sense as I was the second, if not third person, to have touched the set of news paper.</p>
