<p class="whiteline"><p>Something is <em>seriously</em> wrong. We didn&#8217;t have any recess on Friday as we only have a 20 minute recess scheduled within the circular hours and there wasn&#8217;t enough time to eat then (9.00am). Our 2nd block of 20 minute recess was supposed to be at 12.20 pm but somebody professionally &#8220;didn&#8217;t care&#8221; and decided that lessons are more important than recess. This explains why on week A Fridays, we do not consider ourselves to have any recess for the whole day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another amazing thing is that people can suddenly start ranting about the establishment in the middle of lessons.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I say this again, Regulation without Relation or Understanding <em>will</em> lead to Rebellion. Send feedback they say; sent feedback we did. What&#8217;s changed? That&#8217;s for you to say.</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Looking at my results slip, I see grade boundaries nicely shifted in moderation and moderation of percentage sparingly applied. This is so that that international organisation wouldn&#8217;t think that we are doing badly?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>At the rate this goes, it seems like it&#8217;s time to start sourcing for 10GB thumbdrives and hacks to work around Windows&#8217; idiosyncrasies.
