<p class="whiteline"><p>Bloody Hell. Just realised that my phone had <em>not</em> been receiving smses for the <em>whole</em> of today; until I rebooted it. Damn.. 20 plus sms flooding my inbox now. Tons of apologies to send; hope this doesn&#8217;t affect my business.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Singapore Expo&#8217;s really crowded every Sunday henceforth. The queues will make you want to think twice on eating, regardless of hunger. To top that off, the Expo MRT station platform was really flooded with people. The esclator landing (platform level) had a major bottle neck and people really had to walk backwards on the esclator to prevent walking people. Amusing sight.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>After lunch at BK at Changi Airport, went back to Tempines to shop for some clothes. Bought a few shirts and pants. Then had high tea and went home after that.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;m really tired now.</p></p>
