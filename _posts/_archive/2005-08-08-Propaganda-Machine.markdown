<p class="whiteline"><p>(School&#8217;s) National Day Parade was great. Well done to all those who made it look nice; sacrificing studying time for rehersals and all, I&#8217;m sure that the school would be very proud of you all.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The yearly recital is getting stale. Something new please.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The awards presentation which followed was quite long but not as long as the Honours&#8217; Day. Nothing beats Honours&#8217; Day in duration.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The community singing was terrible to say the least. It requires inch-thick worth of skin to stand on stage to <i>motivate</i>, <i>teach</i> and <em>dance</em>, especially when people below are restless and only cared about going home.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The &#8220;reception&#8221; after the service was nice but they could have altered the menu a little. Same thing for all three to four years tend to get a little boring. Or maybe, they didn&#8217;t expect repeated and frequent prize receipients?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Anyway, had a RoD function after the proceedings.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>It wasn&#8217;t bad. Nice food (again =p) and great events (which took place). Nostalgia of my UYO is back... Bah.. It&#8217;ll be gone in a few weeks time, I hope.</p></p>
