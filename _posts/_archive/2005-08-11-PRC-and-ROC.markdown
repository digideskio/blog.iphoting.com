<p class="whiteline"><p>I support ROC&#8217;s independence from PRC.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Why?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I hate PRC&#8217;s way of governance. Since ROC is already independent de-facto, I don&#8217;t see the problem of it just going on as it is. The PRCs must be out to create trouble within this peaceful straits.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Just installed bogofilter and merged it into my qmail-scanner. Now with two spam filters employing different algorithms, the spam score would be further balanced. Less false-negatives. Just found one false-positive in my Junk folder. That mail was from M$ Support. Oh btw, I&#8217;ve turned off qconfirm as it had generated a large amounts of troublesome double-bounces.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh also, I&#8217;ve removed zoneedit&#8217;s backup mail server and just added my friends&#8217; servers into my MX. That&#8217;ll save me US$11 yearly.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Got my Physics and Chem Tests results back. A2 marks only... Darned. How to get A1. Simple tests also can&#8217;t get 80%... Looks like I&#8217;ll need to work even harder.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>After so long, I&#8217;ve just realised that there&#8217;s a quote feature in this blog system. Real neat.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve been surfing blogs lately and found the wordings of my disclaimer appearing on multiple blog disclaimers. Well, I have to say that the disclaimer is written by me and not merely lifted from somewhere. Although the last sentence (in caps) was adapted. So, another disclaimer: Should my disclaimer fail to disclaim you (should you choose to use it) in court or wherever, I shall not be held responsible.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I think I&#8217;d better add the last sentence into my disclaimer post.</p></p>
