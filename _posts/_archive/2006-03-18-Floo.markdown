</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In other news, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/03/barrier-barrier-killer-barrier.html']);"  href="http://happycitizen.blogspot.com/2006/03/barrier-barrier-killer-barrier.html">this article</a> further augments my point on the educational system. I would have laughed had it not been of such graveness.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>A few days back, I remember a teacher telling us about how another teacher was bragging to him about how good this class was. The joke was that both teachers teaches my class and that one of them view us as his best; the other as his worst.</p>

</p><p class="break"><p>Now to read and comprehend my Chemistry textbook before I go to bed. I predict that my mind would be busy with such concepts while my eyes are closed later in the night, allowing my subconsciousness to revise the topics effectively. It&#8217;s usually my eyes that needed rest, rarely my mind.</p></p>
