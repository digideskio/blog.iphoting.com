<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, during Mathematics class, we were looking at graphs of y&#8217; = x on a y against x axis. While at it, we came up with numerous compatible solution to the first order differential. Then, it suddenly came to a keychain on somebody&#8217;s pencil box and this conversation ensured.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;Why do you have a bra keychain on your pencil box,&#8221; person A asked person C.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;I think she needs support,&#8221; responded person B.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Then, thunderous laughter followed. My Mathematics teacher was momentarily suicidal due to someone being able to create greater intensity of laugher than he can ever attempt to induce. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
