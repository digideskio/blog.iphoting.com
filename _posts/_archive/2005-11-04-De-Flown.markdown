<p class="whiteline"><p>Hmm.. Apparently I&#8217;m recovering quicker then I&#8217;ve expected and I didn&#8217;t need to visit a doctor (and waste a morning). Thanks to God and all of you who&#8217;d kept me in your prayers. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I think I&#8217;ve found out what went wrong. I drank too much cold drinks, i.e. Coke Lime and/or PepsiTwist and/or Sprite, etc. And maybe, an occasional lack of sleep thanks to mosquitoes (even with air-conditioning).</p>
