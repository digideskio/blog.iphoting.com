<p class="break"><p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done this aural-oral as well as my prelims. I stumbled on a few words in the beginning of the passage and that I had a rather long (3 second) pause during one of my response to the conversation topic. I took a rather long time in &#8220;discussing&#8221; the picture though. I hope that&#8217;ll help pull up my marks a little.</p></p>
