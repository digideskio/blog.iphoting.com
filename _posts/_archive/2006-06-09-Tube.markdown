<p class="whiteline"><p>On the forth day, my digestive system has yet to reach maximum compatibility and reliability. In short, I&#8217;m still sick. I got to get out of the house to enjoy some fresh air and sights tomorrow; the past days have been mind numbing. At times, I&#8217;m wondering how badly time is wasted as I am not able to study nor work due to my extreme sleepiness which accompanies all sicknesses.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Surf the web I did however, and I manage to come across the following interesting websites.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.physorg.com/news68917335.html']);"  href="http://www.physorg.com/news68917335.html">Microsoft plans better disclosures for piracy monitoring tool</a>, which in short means that Microsoft&#8217;s <em>Genuine Advantage</em> programme is actually phoning home! Another reason not to trust them. I wonder what new technologies would be in Vista to help them combat piracy... after all, it&#8217;s got to be better than the last right?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Ever thought .Mac is cool, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/index.html']);"  href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/index.html">Google Browser Sync</a> is just as cool, albeit without the price. Do check it out if you use Firefox. A Safari version would be cool; or a keychain extension for Firefox would be cool too. Or maybe, extension support for <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.caminobrowser.org/']);"  href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> would be the best.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, if you thought the HK bus uncle was under intense pressure, check out <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbStG50QvbQ']);"  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbStG50QvbQ">Singapore&#8217;s very own angry aunty</a>! I wonder how long Singapore&#8217;s paparazzi (if there&#8217;s even one) would take to identify the characters shown in the lift-made video.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.speedcam.co.uk/gatso2.htm']);"  href="http://www.speedcam.co.uk/gatso2.htm">this</a> demonstrates the freedom in London. How people, annoyed by the fact that speed cameras are used as additional revenue rather than safety, torched the speed cameras into scrap metal. It&#8217;ll be quite cool to have these people along the expressways and woe to the traffic jams (and ERP).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Another thing cool about democratic countries, i.e., those with more than 1 party in the house, is that <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/impeachforpeace.org/']);"  href="http://impeachforpeace.org/">citizens can initiate the impeachment process</a>. Singapore should have these democratic stuff such as the Freedom of Information Act. You ought to be given the right to know where the money goes, since you&#8217;re a <em>citizen</em>, right?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s this gadget that I&#8217;d long to have. It&#8217;s finally available in market form and known as the <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.sleeptracker.com.sg/']);"  href="http://www.sleeptracker.com.sg/">SleepTracker</a>. It &#8220;monitors your body and continuously looks for your best possible waking times&#8221;, and triggers the alarm when such is found, giving you the best feeling when you begin the day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Last one. I like this company, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.lala.com/']);"  href="http://www.lala.com/">La la</a>. It &#8220;allows fans to trade music discs for just $1 plus shipping, pledges to give a fifth of its sales to all the musicians, including lesser-known session studio players, involved in the making of CDs exchanged on its site&#8221; (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.wired.com/news/wireservice/1,71104-0.html']);"  href="http://www.wired.com/news/wireservice/1,71104-0.html">Wired</a>). I&#8217;d love to see the excuse RIAA uses to take down this &#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221; site.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;ll not add in anymore food for thought today.</p></p>
