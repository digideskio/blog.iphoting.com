<p class="whiteline"><p>While I was back in school, we complained and whined about the poor implementation and execution of the IBDP. I thought I was sitting through the worst movie that can ever be produced by the school.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Fast-forward a year, little did I know, the worst has yet to hit rock bottom. When fellow alumni are told of the things that are present, it solicits exclamatory remarks coupled with sighs of relief that they are now alumni and need not witness cultural and spirit massacre first hand. One thing for sure is that a certain degree of unrest and annoyance is stirring.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The question is, can it get even worst before the cause is eliminated? More importantly, what is the cause? Apparently, every other significant person to the cause have left or been forced to leave on grounds &#8220;told not to speculate&#8221;. The rest are either new or couldn&#8217;t leave due to life obligations (such as children). Speaking of new, they leave as fast as they enter. Something must be terribly wrong, not in the state of Denmark!</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, what do all these actually mean? Can we still sleep soundly over it?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Speaking of sleep, I&#8217;ve come across this interesting <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=how-snoozing-makes-you-smarter&amp;amp;print=true']);"  href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=how-snoozing-makes-you-smarter&amp;print=true">article</a> which talks about the process in which the mind undergoes while you&#8217;re sleeping at night.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve always this impression that your mind is hard at work while you&#8217;re asleep, and that&#8217;s why I put huge emphasis on sleeping, whether while I was still schooling or serving my time in the mental jail known as the army.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>While I was on doing my IB Dip course, I&#8217;d always made it a point to take a good nap right before working on thinking intensive work, such as essay writing and mathematics portfolios. Most of the time, I&#8217;ll awake with inspiration on how to tackle questions or simply having found out what to write for an essay.</p>
