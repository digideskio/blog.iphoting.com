<p class="whiteline"><p>Today in my English Tuition, we talked about the meaning of life. The world outside the four walls and what we&#8217;d all taken granted for.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Many many things, from how to solve problems to why Polys are more practical (pardon the pun) than JCs.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Live with no regrets.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Mid-life crisis - a very common thing.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The Singapore Education is finally being revamped... a little late.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Making money is not easy... Effort is required.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Live life to the fullest.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Have faith in God.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Human persona - It&#8217;s effects.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It makes me wonder. Are people less tolerant of the persona of others or is it that past generations have higher tolerance threshold?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Why can&#8217;t JCs have the benefits of Poly? Pointless studying something that you&#8217;re unlikely to use 10 years down the road. Furthermore, I was told that the Characters of A Level Certification holders are not as <em>valued</em> in terms of employablity as Diploma holders. Moreover, diplomas are of a higher level than a cert. Notwithstanding that, companies now almost only hire people who have had working/hands-on experience.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Where&#8217;s the future in JCs?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Next, we talked about Projects vs. Examinations. The good thing about projects is that it&#8217;s fully controllable. You can <em>choose</em> to do well, i.e. put in more effort, make more in-depth research, etc. However, it&#8217;s entirely <em>not</em> the case in Examinations. What you&#8217;ve studied need not appear in the Test Paper(s). Stress is another factor which is not easily managable.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And, if you think there&#8217;s Project work in JCs, think again. What&#8217;s individual grading within a group? Ironic. &#8220;Think <em>outside</em> the box, just that you&#8217;ll have to keep <em>within</em> this box&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Then, we talked about fortune tellers and why you would most likely not want to be able to see the future. Next up, we also talked about whether Ghosts (or something to that effect) exist around us. According to consensus, majority agreed that there was some form of such but nobody wanted to dwell on the topic.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Now, I&#8217;d realised that I&#8217;ve lost all pressure on exams. No motivation, no nothing. I&#8217;ve lost the gas. The acceleration has stopped. In fact, I might have been deccelerating. Somebody, something, wake me up.</p></p>
