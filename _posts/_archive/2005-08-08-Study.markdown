<p class="whiteline"><p>After having delayed for a week, I&#8217;m finally mentally geared for studying. My room has been reconfigured for studying purposes and useless stuff now take position on the floor as opposed to books previously.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The sermon on <em>vision</em> finally woke me up on what my current mental state currently is. I&#8217;ve been drifting back to the old ways as I&#8217;ve not painted and imprinted my vision clearly within my mind and walls of my room.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That shall be the past. 8 points, I shall get. I&#8217;ve got the skills, I&#8217;ll just need a little more practice and knowledge reinforced into my dynamic memory.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Hmm... Picnic tomorrow. I wonder how it&#8217;ll be like.</p></p>
