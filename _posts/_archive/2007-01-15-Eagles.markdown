<p class="whiteline"><p>On my way home from school today, I thought I was in a nightmare, but boy no, I wasn&#8217;t sleeping. Please do not be offended by what I see, I&#8217;m just helping you visualise my perspective.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If you&#8217;ve noticed, there&#8217;s now an eagle carved in stone housed on a platform at the old parade square, directly above the time capsule. If you look carefully, the whole set up looks like an altar, with the eagle statue set up like an idol; the platform makes it a perfect place to put various pagan sacrifices. I heard that there&#8217;s one more white one at the artificial turf.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Frankly, whoever that came up with the design and/or came up with the build material needs to be shot.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Blasphemous in short.</p></p>
