<p class="whiteline"><p>Commitment â€“ W.N. Murray</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Until one is committed there is hesitancy,</p><p class="break">the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness.</p><p class="break">Concerning all acts of initiative, (and creation)</p><p class="break">there is one elementary truth,</p><p class="break">the ignorance of which,</p><p class="break">kills countless ideas and splendid plans:</p><p class="break">that the moment one definitely commits oneself,</p><p class="break">then providence moves too!</p><p class="break">All sorts of things occur to help one,</p><p class="break">that would otherwise never have occurred.</p><p class="break">A stream of events issues from the decision,</p><p class="break">raising in one&#8217;s favor,</p><p class="break">all manner of unforeseen incidents,</p><p class="break">meetings, and material assistance,</p><p class="break">which no person could have dreamt</p><p class="whiteline">would have come their way.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Now now, what now?</p></p>
