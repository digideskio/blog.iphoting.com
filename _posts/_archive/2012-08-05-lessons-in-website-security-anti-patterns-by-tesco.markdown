> Curious, as always, I headed over to [tesco.com](http://tesco.com) to take a look. A few cursory glances around showed perhaps there was a bit of an opportunity here â€“ an education opportunity for developers who like to learn from anti-patterns, i.e. seeing how those who have gone before them have done it wrong.
