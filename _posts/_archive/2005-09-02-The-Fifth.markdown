<p class="whiteline"><p>This is worrying. The past 5 papers had been too easy. Much easier than I&#8217;ve expected. This worries me even more. It&#8217;s either I&#8217;m a genius (unlikely), the papers were really easy, the teachers wanted to give us a false sense of confidence, I&#8217;ve got very sufficient preparation (I doubt), or it&#8217;s reverse psychology (by teachers).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>And since the papers are easy, I&#8217;d better get A1s for all those that I&#8217;ve taken so far. If not, then, I guess I&#8217;ve found the hidden weapon that the teachers are hiding.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Oh well, I better make good use of my Spetember &#8220;holidays&#8221; to get my theory knowledge to a definite A1 standard. I must think of a plan for Higher Chinese.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Somehow, I feel that my IQ has <i>dropped</i> by <em>at least</em> <em>20</em> points since I was in Sec 2. Must be the education system and boring environment; simply no brain teasers. This should be the reason why my responses have become slower as time passes. I seemed to have aged a lot (a Bad Thing TM).</p></p>
