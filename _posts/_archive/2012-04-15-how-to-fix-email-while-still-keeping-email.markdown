> MIME email includes a multipart/alternative header that allows you to send alternative versions of the same message; almost always to have an HTML and a Plain Text version of the same email; where the latter doesn't have to be simply an HTML stripped version of the former.

To say the least, it is a brilliant idea. I can't wait for the day where my email client is more than just a window to little pieces of notesâ€”I want them to do something relevant depending on their individual context.

So obvious, and yet so far from reality.
