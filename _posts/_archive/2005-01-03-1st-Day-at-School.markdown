<p class="whiteline"><p>The first day of School, 3rd Jan, 2005, was a blast. Lacking sleep and an increase if pressure by 90%, it wasn&#8217;t a nice day.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In the morning, although I thought I&#8217;d left my house on time, I&#8217;d arrived at the Dover Road Junction at 7.05am. However, the traffic congestion was so terrible that I&#8217;d to walk to school from next to ITE (7.30am) to just be in time.... Bad.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>During that dreadfully long H. Chinese period, the teacher demanded homework or a Chinese Compo (500 words) to be handed <em>by</em> the next day. That&#8217;s the stress.</p></p>
