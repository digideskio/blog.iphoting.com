<p class="break"><p>I fully support the abolishment of 10% service charge at various service oriented outlets. My past experiences with certain restaurants have not been entirely plesant. It makes me wonder if the 10% service charge goes to the &#8216;service providers&#8217; instead of the products themselves.</p></p>
