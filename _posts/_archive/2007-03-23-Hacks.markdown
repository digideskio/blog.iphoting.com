Sometimes, I just wonder, what on earth is going on. On my way home on one of the days, I saw this advertisement outside the school.

To be frank, I&#8217;m impressed. Advertisers sure know where to target for any potential untapped market.

Apart from that, today marks the day of a second Hack the school has seen. As for the first, I haven&#8217;t managed to get a photograph, but this time, I decided to make good use of my phone&#8217;s camera, outside school hours of course.

From my observations, every teacher or student who saw the hack for the first time burst out in good laughter. My congratulations to the owner of this good hack; well done! It certainly brought life back to school. Oh, to the uninformed/uninitiated, the face below the words, &#8216;EETOK&#8217; is a sad one.

Amusingly, some teachers commented that the hack in itself though good, but it still wasn&#8217;t perfect. The text should read &#8216;TOKEE&#8217; instead as it is easier and more fun to pronounce.

Yesterday, I happen to have a great chat with one of my former teachers. That teacher, I have to admit, was one of the best that had taught me so far. In that short span, we talked about how school have changed and how long school hours have become, detrimental to health.

On my way home that day, I also bumped into a teacher on the way home who somehow lives near me. No doubt, school hours are way too long for healthy family relationships and it serves as a good warning / reminder to avoid this school like plague if I were to become a teacher.
