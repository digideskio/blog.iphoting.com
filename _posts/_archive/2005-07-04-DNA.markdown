<p class="whiteline"><p>Oh well, I should be doing my English comprehension and sudying for my &#21548;&#20889; tomorrow, but this came to my mind and I can&#8217;t seem to shake it off. So here it goes.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>DNA is portable across all species on Earth, regardless of race, religion or language, and possibily more.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p><a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose_nucleic_acid']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose_nucleic_acid">DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)</a>, as you&#8217;ve already known, contains instructions and validations to the synthesis of proteins and other (un)known uses. This 4 character A, C, G, T code, suprisingly, is portable across <em>all</em> species on Earth. For elements outside Earth, that&#8217;s something for the scientists to prove.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>So, how can species, from ants to humans, elephants to bacteria, with such great variation on the &#8220;outside&#8221; be so similar in the &#8220;inside&#8221;, i.e. being governed by a single unified <em>four-letter</em> &#8220;language&#8221;?</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>God and/or Nature, is amazing beyond measure or comprehension.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Why is there an existance of portability in DNA? Why not have it specific to each species and thus prevent &#8220;cross contamination&#8221;? Or maybe, &#8220;<em>someone</em>&#8221; wanted to code everything in one language, so as to easy maintanence?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>With such, is there a &#8220;<em>primary</em>&#8221; unified source for all these? A simple (un)fortunate or coincidental combination of the percentage of Carbon can&#8217;t really be the main reason, can it?</p></p>
