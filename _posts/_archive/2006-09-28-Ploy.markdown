<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;ve finally fallen sick enough for me to decide to stay home, and visit a friendly doctor for an MC instead thanks to school policy. I know I&#8217;m down with the symptoms of stress and minor viral infection but to appease administrators without wasting resources, I decided that a Polyclinic would be the most efficient and cost effective method. Hey, it&#8217;s just a 15 minute bus ride from my house too. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>True enough, I entered the fully air-conditioned place and left within 30 minutes, with a MC in hand, and with enough spare time to marvel at their high-tech communications and patients management systems (read: CRM). This $6 visit was certainly worth in terms of time, MC and monetary value. I&#8217;m quite sure the duration of a private clinic visit would take as long too, but at 5 times the cost.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Oh well, another genuine time waster tomorrow, but with school spirit, I shall turn up for school events despite its proximity to my examinations. After all, the administrators, given their <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence']);"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence">intelligence</a>, must have foreseen that too, I hope.</p></p>
