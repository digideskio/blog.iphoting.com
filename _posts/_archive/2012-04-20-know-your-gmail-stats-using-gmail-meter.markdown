[Official Gmail Blog][1]:

> Gmail Meter is an Apps Script which runs on the first day of every month and sends you an email containing different statistics about your Inbox. In a similar way to how recently introduced Google Account Activity gives key stats about how youâ€™ve used your Google Account, Gmail Meter gives you different types of statistics that will help you analyze your Gmail habits.

With 7 different categories of statistics available, the Gmail Meter is quite an awesome tool to visualise your email graphically and statistically.

For instructions on how to set it up, visit their blog post.
