<p class="whiteline"><p>Today, observing the sequence of activities and events unfolding before my eyes, this chapter of the Bible stood out prominently in my mind, <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:12-26;&amp;amp;version=9;']);"  href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:12-26;&amp;version=9;">1 Cor 12:12-26</a>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>It speaks of <em>unity</em> and <em>diversity</em> within a body and how important it is to respect differences and work together. &#8220;<sup>12</sup>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.&#8221; and &#8220;<sup>25</sup>That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. <sup>26</sup>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Of importance is that &#8220;there should be no <em>schism</em> in the body&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I find it extremely saddening when disagreements within a body cannot be resolved peacefully within itself via win-win negotiation and arrangements. Requiring an external party to mediate and dictate is a declaration of organisational incompetence and total disregard for leadership, if any. &#8220;Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand&#8221; (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%2012:25;&amp;amp;version=9;']);"  href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%2012:25;&amp;version=9;">Matt 12:25</a>).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>&#8220;Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.&#8221; (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=prov%2010:12;&amp;amp;version=9;']);"  href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=prov%2010:12;&amp;version=9;">Prov 10:12</a>)</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>If nothing, have LOVE for members of the same body, so that there would be peace and that differences be bridged.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>In other news, amusingly, I&#8217;ve heard news of orders sent for teachers to conduct mobile phone checks more regularly. It quite shows where priorities lie.</p></p>
