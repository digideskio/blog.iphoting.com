<p class="whiteline"><p>Part of what Rev Casey Treat talked about this morning was the following verse (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%202:9;&amp;amp;version=50;']);"  href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%202:9;&amp;version=50;">1 Cor 2:9</a>), which enlightened me.</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">But as it is written:</p><p class="break">“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,</p><p class="break">Nor have entered into the heart of man</p><p class="break">The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>But, that&#8217;s not the crux. The crux lies in the following verse (<a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%202:10;&amp;amp;version=50;']);"  href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%202:10;&amp;version=50;">1 Cor 2:10</a>):-</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Ah ha! The things of the God, in the spiritual, are hidden from the natural. Which makes perfect sense why it&#8217;s hard to see, hear, or understand God and what he is doing without listening to the Holy Spirit.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>As it is written in <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13;&amp;amp;version=50;']);"  href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13;&amp;version=50;">John 16:13</a>, &#8220;However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Catching a glimpse into eternity and into the future, seeing things that eyes have not seen, ears have not heard, is something I greatly appreciate – deja vu. Hehe, also known as fortune-teling when a fee is charged; no idea how accurate those in the streets are though. <img src="http://static-s3.iphoting.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/laugh.png" alt=":-D" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></p>
