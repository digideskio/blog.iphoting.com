<p class="whiteline"><p>I was at SimLim square some time ago and I overheard this conversation in the tiny lift. Since the couple was talking about Macs, I became interested in what they have to say.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The lady was whining about how bad the Mighty Mouse is - &#8220;It has only one mouse button at this time and age!&#8221; Their Keyboards too are more expensive than any other similar competing products. What&#8217;s more, all the software are all so expensive and they all have to be original.</p>

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Sounds good. It&#8217;ll be nice that the perception of piracy be kept in the Windows world, so that Mac developers can create even better and prettier software for normal people to use. I&#8217;ll be even happier that ignorant people are kept locked in the PC world as there&#8217;s &#8220;no software for the Mac&#8221;.</p>
