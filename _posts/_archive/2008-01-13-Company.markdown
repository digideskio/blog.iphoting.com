<p class="whiteline"><p>I&#8217;m quite glad. I thank God that people in my platoon and section is pretty decent and intelligent. Knowing when to act competent and when to slack off without getting caught is one of the best synergies I can ever ask for.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>That aside, I get to learn many things despite the boring and tiring routine. Sometimes, you just gotta hold a straight face when something hilarious goes on, or hold your tongue when bureaucratic reasoning gets the better of you.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The harder training that I get is to keep thinking up brain activities to reduce my mental boredom.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, field camp in 2 weeks time.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;m off.</p></p>
