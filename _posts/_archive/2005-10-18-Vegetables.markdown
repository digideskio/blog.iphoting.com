<p class="whiteline"><p>The surprise, or the lack thereof, is a surprise in itself.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Seriously, I was momentarily stunned by the specimens and the bloody rain that is to come. When I&#8217;d entered the lab, vegetables lay before me. A little tiny (5mm x 5mm) green plant, a carrot and an onion.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Upon regaining my composure (barely 10 minutes into the examination), a shriek was heard, right before me. Looking up, I saw a terrified lab technician gesturing wildly at my classmate&#8217;s (who need not be named) hand, where blood was gushing out profusely from one of his fingers. That instant was extremely dramatic. More lab technicians and subject supervisors gather around my dear friend. Application of First-Aid and the use of the first-aid kit, located at the front of the lab, was the first that I&#8217;ve ever saw in my four years in school. The closest was just a plaster for a small cut. This time, it was deep.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Once the red flow of blood has reduced, teachers, or rather people this time, gathered to discuss ways to help him. Injury. Next Practical. Assistance. Extra Time. Anything that they could think of by the rules.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>All these happened right in front of me. If I say that none of these affected me in anyway, I must be joking or heartless. Helping or consoling my friend in anyway would be out of the question as this is <em>the</em> <i>bloody</i> GCE O Level Biology Practical Examination. The last thing anybody needs is to be barred from the examinations for <em>4 years</em>.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Learning from others&#8217; mistakes (it sounds really bad), I decided to use extra and extreme caution on the &#8220;pen-knife&#8221;. The blades themselves are sharp but somehow, when cutting the carrot, the blades tend to get &#8220;stuck&#8221; within the carrot, requiring a certain degree of force to extract the (poor) blade out. That would be or was a potential for disaster.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Even with the employment of extra care in handling the blade while dissecting the carrot, I also had <em>close</em> encounters of splitting my skin. Damn, just provide a decent knife and all would be solved.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Back to the paper, the questions are really theory work (I think) as most of the questions do not require much practical skills (unless you factor in vegetable cutting).</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Three comparison questions carrying 7 marks. I think that&#8217;s my teachers&#8217; day present to all Bio teachers; or maybe MoE or UCLES for being <em>so</em> <i>creative</i> this time.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Ended the day with the game of Bridge. I can&#8217;t believe my luck, the severe lack thereof that is. For 8 games (out of 10), my TCP (total card points) had been hovering about 8. Something like 1 Ace and another small card. Doubletons and singletons. Those with 5 or more, no family. There was at least 2 games where I had a TCP of 4 points, 1 point too much for a wash. Never had a chance to do any bidding at all, not to mention being a declarer (maybe once). Surprisingly (again), I did win a few games. The worst bridge session ever.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Hope your finger heals really fast, in time for the next practicals.</p></p>
