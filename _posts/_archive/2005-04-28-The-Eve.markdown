<p class="whiteline"><p>As of late, the situation is turning grave. Although I have to admit that there had been good things, I feel sad that it&#8217;s spiralling down into a black hole.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Today in class, the atmosphere felt as though the exams had just ended and no one is going to have exams anytime soon. There&#8217;s just not an inch (or whatever you call that) of disclipline. This way, I can be rest assured that somebody won&#8217;t do very well in their papers.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Also, there&#8217;s a new hype over the game, Petals Around the Rose. Sad that I do not own dices. If not, it&#8217;ll be an interesting session, watching people think and count. By simple logical deduction, I&#8217;m sure one would learn that the method of derival of the answer is extremely simple. Not much maths is required.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Rules of the Game are not meant to be broken by the way.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>All the best to everyone who&#8217;s in for an exam starting from tomorrow. Good Luck.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>Don&#8217;t forget to turn up by 9.15am for shift 2 Physics Practical.</p></p>
