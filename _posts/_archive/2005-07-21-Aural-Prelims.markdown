<p class="whiteline"><p>My English Aural-Oral Exam for Prelims was conducted today.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The response (after the test from the teacher) was:-</p><p class="whiteline">&#8220;Very good. Your picture disscussion and conversation was very well done! Especially when you&#8217;d never ran out of anything to say and even intended to continue forever until I told you to stop. However, you&#8217;ve got to work on your stressing for the reading-aloud passage. It&#8217;s not too bad but not too good either.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Nice words, followed by the bomb. Now, I&#8217;ve got to start learning how to read text under stress - my major weakness. For all those nice words that she&#8217;d used, she&#8217;d better give me an A1 or A2 grade for this paper. I would very much want to get decent marks for my English Prelim paper, as it&#8217;s crucial for JC entry.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>The apparent stagnantation of my blog is primarily due to my woresning time management capabilities and my obligations to a new project that I&#8217;ve taken up - To write a new Gunther-like CMS.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Setting up the project collaboration and subversion repository took quite a bit of my time especially when problems crop up. When I say problems, they are those that make you pull your hair and dig through Google and still have no solution or idea of what had went wrong.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Well, for those of you who would love to contribute (it&#8217;s licensed under GPL btw), take a peak at <a href="http://www.iphoting.com/projects/ccc/">http://www.iphoting.com/projects/ccc/</a>.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>I&#8217;d spent quite some time looking for a PHP wiki syntax parser but I&#8217;ve yet to see one. However, I chanced upon textile instead. Similar to wiki in theory of operation but slightly different in syntax. Oh well, who cares about the tiny difference as long as the class is provided. Saved time as I don&#8217;t have to hand code one.</p></p>
