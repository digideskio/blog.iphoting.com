<p class="whiteline"><p>This week was deadly. I didn&#8217;t even have time to sleep a full 8 hours, needless to say, blogging.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, one thing to note that it&#8217;s just the crazy things (non-homework) stuff around that&#8217;s killing all my time.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>There&#8217;s something that Mr J. Wong mentioned that was very good, &#8220;I&#8217;m very loyal to Singapore, however, I <em>dislike</em> the Gahmen&#8221;.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Most of the teachers are good for now.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>English, she&#8217;s a joker... Injecting subtle jokes into her sentences. E. Maths, she&#8217;s clear and concise... can joke also. A. Maths, she&#8217;s boring and slow (when lecturing about the virtues of a perfect class). Can easily make funny jokes from the complains. H. Chinese, nothing special. Geography, the same lameness. History, as exciting as Brian Chirnside. S.S., it&#8217;s a stress relief lesson. Chemistry, miles better than former teacher. Physics, same old soo. Biology, interesting... He can speak as fast as he can think.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Now, for the most interesting thing, the A. Maths teacher <em>insists</em> that we call her by her name instead of plain &#8220;madame&#8221;. So, a greeting for her would go, a little longer. Her rules are a little lame and quite filled with minor loopholes, where we are quick to point out. All in all, it&#8217;s quite a refreshing experience.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>As for NFS:U2, I somehow feel that tackling mountain passes are easier without any Turbo installed.</p></p>
