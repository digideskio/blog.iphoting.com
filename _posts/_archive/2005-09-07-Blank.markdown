<p class="whiteline"><p>My mind has never been so blank before. Today is more of a rule rather than an exception. Trapped in a place called &#8220;LaLa Land&#8221;, losing my way and soon crashing into a bottomless pit, I&#8217;ve yet to wake up from a slumber which is so deadly but yet so addictive.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p><i>&#8220;Wake me up when September ends&#8221;</i>; it&#8217;ll be too late.</p></p>
