<p class="whiteline"><p>Set off on Island Jade at like 10.30am from Tanah Merah Jetty. The sea wasn&#8217;t calm. When we departed, it was sea state 1. So, all went on as usual.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>However, 1.5 hours later, when we are about to approach the Horsburgh Lighthouse, the sea became less calm and it became sea state 2. It was quite rough to those land-based people, but strangely no one threw up. Many were feeling sick though. The stop at the Lighthouse was canceled due to unfavourable seas as slowing down the ship from 20 knots is bound to make the ship jerk even more. So, we turned back and headed back to Jetty.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The thing thus ended at 5pm.</p></p>
