</p><blockquote><p class="break">^^Ferdie Dud: hmm</p><p class="break">いいわね、キョン！: Yes sir?</p><p class="break">^^Ferdie Dud: I wonder if your blog is prophetic</p><p class="break">^^Ferdie Dud: that I will leave the school before you do</p><p class="break">^^Ferdie Dud: will 3 more years</p><p class="break">^^Ferdie Dud: a long time</p><p class="break">^^Ferdie Dud: maybe you are right</p><p class="break">いいわね、キョン！: >&#95;> Sir.

</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Things that happened lately in school has not been in anyway pleasurable to me. This week alone, a group 4 science project has been gracefully announced with an expected time frame of competition placed at 2 days, starting next Friday. Then, there&#8217;s this mathematics portfolio to be completed within one week, starting from next Monday. Not to mention, there are a pile of made-to-be-difficult tests coming up within the next two weeks. All these and more, even my palm has difficulty keeping track of.</p>
