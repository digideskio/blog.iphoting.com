[Guardian][source]:

> Brilliant. It was very, very well done. This was about Great Britain; it didn't pretend it was trying to have global appeal. Because Great Britain has self-confidence, it doesn't need a monumental Olympics. But for China that was the only imaginable kind of international event. Beijing's Olympics were very grand – they were trying to throw a party for the world, but the hosts didn't enjoy it. The government didn't care about people's feelings because it was trying to create an image.

> In London, they really turned the ceremony into a party – they are proud of themselves and respect where they come from, from the industrial revolution to now. I never saw an event before that had such a density of information about events and stories and literature and music; about folktales and movies.

Personally, I felt that it was artistically splendid. There was ordered-chaos, imperfections, acceptance, and a strong will to showcase the people of London, especially on the individual level.

The Chinese ceremony, on the other hand, was a sculpted show. An illusion of grandeur:

> The Chinese ceremony had so much less information and it wasn't even real. It wasn't only about the little girl who was miming – which was an injury to her and the girl whose voice was used – but that symbolically showed the nation's future. You can't trust or rely on individuals or the state's efforts.

Ultimately, I am thoroughly impressed by London's efforts. They succeeded in responding to Beijing's showcase, but in their own personalised terms—terms that Beijing is most ashamed of.

That being said, [this Quora question][1] highlights some of subtle details from the London opening that viewers may have missed.
