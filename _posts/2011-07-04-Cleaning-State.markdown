<p>I first got my Mac in 2006 when the first Intel-based Macbook came onto the market, running Mac OS X 10.4.4, and have upgraded to every new OS X release ever since. The seamless OS upgrades have really spoilt me and made me put off doing a clean install for the past 5 years.</p>

<p>Now that Lion has finally reached Gold Master (GM) status, I shall now take this opportunity in the summer holidays to do a clean install of Lion, blasting ageing and possibly incompatible software and configuration files into the trash. Of course, the toughest part to any reinstallation is backups and now is the best time to test how well my backup regime and redundancy holds.</p>

<p>Wish me luck.</p>
