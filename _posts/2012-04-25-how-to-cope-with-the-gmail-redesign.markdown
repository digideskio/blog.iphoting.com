> Reports are coming in from around the Internet that the Gmail redesign, which we were previously able to stave off with “revert to the old look temporarily”, is now forcing itself upon us. I too have succumbed to the new design, and have been forced to find ways to cope. Here’s what I did to make it semi-bearable.

I didn't express how annoying the new "redesign" of all Google properties were. In one word—horrible. Everything was made harder to read, harder to use, and whitespace was made too plentiful.

Follow Jason's post for a step-by-step guide to make the Gmail interface more usable.

Personally, I've switched to Mail.app and [Sparrow][1] for all my email needs.
