<p class="whiteline"><p>Listening in forums about the iPhone, many claim that they prefer other &#8216;touchscreen&#8217; phones such as LG&#8217;s or Samsung&#8217;s, etc, whereby all but one fail to consider or realise the difference in their touchscreen technology.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>iPhone and the iPod Touch uses a capacitance-based system, where it is &#8220;skin-activated&#8221; rather than pressure activated. As such, just tapping with your fingertips would produce a result. On the other hand, most other touchscreen phones employ a pressure-based touchscreen system, where a precise and pressured point is required to register an input. Moreover, most pressure-based touchscreens are confused when the size of the pressure point increases. Thus, the usage of fingers rather than fingernails on such touchscreens result in poor recognition. A stylus is therefore usually provided.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>This tiny but distinct difference is huge enough to affect usability experience to the extent that it makes or breaks &#8220;typing&#8221; on the on-screen virtual full-sized keyboard. This also explains why critics of the iPhone claim that it is impossible to type on the iPhone virtual full-sized keyboard as they fail to realise the subtle difference in technology employed.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>In my opinion, the capacitance-based touchscreen system is worth more than enough to compensate the apparent &#8220;software fixable&#8221; cons such as the lack of MMS, cut and paste, email attachment support.</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>The only problem thus far is the built-in battery with a three-digit replacement figure.</p></p>
