<p class="whiteline"><p>Summarising John Gruber in <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/daringfireball.net/2011/06/windows_8_fundamentally_flawed']);"  href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/windows_8_fundamentally_flawed">his post</a>, &#8220;Why Windows 8 Is Fundamentally Flawed as a Response to the iPad&#8221;:</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">
Apple’s radical notion is that touchscreen personal computers should make severely different tradeoffs than traditional computers — and that you can’t design one system that does it all. Windows 8 is trying to have it all, and I don’t think that can be done. You can’t make something conceptually lightweight if it’s carrying 25 years of Windows baggage.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Jared Newman <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/techland.time.com/2011/06/02/why-apple-enthusiasts-are-wrong-about-windows-8/']);"  href="http://techland.time.com/2011/06/02/why-apple-enthusiasts-are-wrong-about-windows-8/">disagrees by claiming</a> that a Tablet being all-in-one, with both the new Windows 8 interface and the old windows interface integrated, will be more successful:</p>
</p><blockquote><p class="break">
What Microsoft demonstrated on Wednesday is exactly what I want in a computer — a lightweight tablet UI that&#8217;s meant for casual computing and a powerful, classic Windows that allows me to work.</p></blockquote><p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>I disagree with Newman on this count as his premise is untenable: &#8220;There will be demand for touch-based apps simply because of how many people are already using Windows.&#8221;</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Just because you are a Windows user does not mean that you will use the new Touch UI add-on as the classic Windows interface is still available. There is a tendency for people to fall back to familiar grounds, despite new improvements that could be had in learning and employing new technology.</p>
</p><p class="whiteline"><p>Furthermore, why would anyone use the new Touch UI interface when there are hardly any applications written for it? While Newman claims that &#8220;Microsoft has proven willing to grow its app ecosystem by <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/extlink/www.intomobile.com/2010/07/14/microsoft-paying-devs-for-windows-phone-7-apps/']);"  href="http://www.intomobile.com/2010/07/14/microsoft-paying-devs-for-windows-phone-7-apps/">paying developers</a>&#8221; (as seen in Windows Phone 7), that doesn&#8217;t explain why 3rd-party applications on WP7 are still lacking in quality and quantity—What app would you use for GPS running, SSH, VNC, Tweeting, Facebook or Things?</p>
</p><p class="break"><p>So really, creating an ecosystem isn&#8217;t as simple as paying a few  developers to port their stuff and leaving a legacy interface behind for &#8220;compatibility reasons&#8221;. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t succeeded, but Apple has. Windows 7 will just be another Windows 7 with its new Touch UI relegated to an &#8220;Apple Dashboard-like&#8221; position in the OS.</p></p>
