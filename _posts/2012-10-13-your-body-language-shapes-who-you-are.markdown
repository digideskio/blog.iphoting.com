Amy Cuddy gave an awesome TED talk, "[Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are][source]". I urge everyone to set aside 20 minutes and watch it.

> Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how “power posing” -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don’t feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain, and might even have an impact on our chances for success.
