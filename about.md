Hello, I am Ronald. I am an Accountant, Techie, and a Foodie. I graduated from Singapore Management University and am a Risk Assurance Associate with PwC.

By day, I help clients with their US Tax Compliance (FATCA) issues and by night, I dabble with systems administration and software integration. I love bringing software pieces together and have them function beautifully as a whole.

This is my blog where I write about Technology and Current Affairs.
